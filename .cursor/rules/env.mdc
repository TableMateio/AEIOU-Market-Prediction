there is a .env file with all of the keys
you don't have access for security reasons stop asking.
if you need something to be added to it, then tell me and i'll add it manually
you can look to env.example in the root to see what variables you can know are in the .env file.
stop asking for me to create ones or put the info in there if you see it in env.example. if it's there, you can assume it's in my .env file which exists even if you can't see it. you need to trust.
