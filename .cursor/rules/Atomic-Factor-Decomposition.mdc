# Atomic Factor Decomposition - Granular Belief Modeling

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Principle: Every Business Factor = Magnitude Ã— Multi-Dimensional Belief Structure

**RULE: No Vague Composite Scores**
- Every factor must decompose to atomic components
- Each component has a clear measurement scale (0-1)
- Belief dimensions apply to EVERY business factor
- All factors are programmatically combinable

---

## ðŸ§® Universal Belief Dimension Framework

Every business factor gets scored across these dimensions:

```typescript
interface AtomicBeliefDimensions {
  // Core belief strength
  intensity_belief: number;     // 0-1: How strongly they believe the magnitude
  duration_belief: number;      // 0-1: How long they think it will last
  certainty_level: number;      // 0-1: Confidence in their assessment
  
  // Emotional spectrum
  hope_vs_fear: number;        // 0-1: 0=pure fear, 0.5=neutral, 1=pure hope
  doubt_factor: number;        // 0-1: Skepticism about the outcome
  
  // Predictability assessment
  predictability: number;       // 0-1: How predictable this factor is
  clarity_score: number;        // 0-1: How clear the implications are
  
  // Impact perception
  impact_feeling: number;       // 0-1: How "big" this feels (psychological magnitude)
  durability_score: number;    // 0-1: How permanent/lasting the effect is
  sensitivity: number;          // 0-1: How sensitive to external conditions
}
```

## ðŸ“Š Example: Layoffs Event - Proper Atomic Decomposition

### Raw News:
*"Apple announces 10% workforce reduction affecting primarily retail and services divisions due to slowing iPhone sales."*

### Atomic Factor Breakdown:

**1. COST_REDUCTION Factor**
```typescript
const cost_reduction = {
  raw_business_magnitude: 0.08,  // 8% estimated cost reduction
  
  belief_dimensions: {
    intensity_belief: 0.85,      // Strong belief 8% will be achieved
    duration_belief: 0.70,       // Believe savings will last ~2 years
    certainty_level: 0.75,       // High confidence in cost math
    hope_vs_fear: 0.25,         // More fear than hope (0.25 = fearful)
    doubt_factor: 0.30,          // Moderate doubt about full realization
    predictability: 0.80,        // Cost cutting is predictable
    clarity_score: 0.85,         // Very clear what cost reduction means
    impact_feeling: 0.60,        // Feels like meaningful but not huge
    durability_score: 0.65,      // May erode over time with hiring
    sensitivity: 0.40            // Not very sensitive to externals
  },
  
  // Derived calculation
  weighted_belief_strength: 0.62  // Composite of all dimensions
};
```

**2. KNOWLEDGE_LOSS Factor**
```typescript
const knowledge_loss = {
  raw_business_magnitude: 0.15,  // 15% capability reduction estimate
  
  belief_dimensions: {
    intensity_belief: 0.70,      // Believe significant knowledge will be lost
    duration_belief: 0.90,       // Knowledge loss feels permanent
    certainty_level: 0.65,       // Moderate confidence (hard to quantify)
    hope_vs_fear: 0.80,         // High fear about losing critical expertise

```

    duration_belief: 0.55,       // Think it's temporary-ish
    certainty_level: 0.40,       // Low confidence (hard to measure execution)
    hope_vs_fear: 0.70,         // Fear about execution problems
    doubt_factor: 0.50,          // Significant doubt about magnitude
    predictability: 0.25,        // Execution capability very unpredictable
    clarity_score: 0.20,         // Very unclear what "execution" means
    impact_feeling: 0.65,        // Feels impactful but fuzzy
    durability_score: 0.40,      // May recover as teams rebuild
    sensitivity: 0.85            // Highly sensitive to market demands
  },
  
  weighted_belief_strength: 0.45
};
```

**4. MARKET_PERCEPTION Factor**
```typescript
const market_perception = {
  raw_business_magnitude: -0.05, // 5% negative market positioning
  
  belief_dimensions: {
    intensity_belief: 0.80,      // Strong belief this looks bad
    duration_belief: 0.30,       // Think market will forget quickly
    certainty_level: 0.70,       // Confident about immediate perception hit
    hope_vs_fear: 0.75,         // Fear about looking weak
    doubt_factor: 0.35,          // Some doubt about lasting impact
    predictability: 0.60,        // Market reactions somewhat predictable
    clarity_score: 0.75,         // Clear that layoffs = weakness signal
    impact_feeling: 0.50,        // Moderate psychological impact
    durability_score: 0.25,      // Market perception changes quickly
    sensitivity: 0.90            // Very sensitive to other news/performance

## ðŸ§¬ Factor Interaction Framework

  cost_reduction_vs_market_perception: -0.30  // Weak negative correlation
};

## ðŸ”¬ Validation: Each Factor Must Pass Tests

**Atomicity Test:**
- Can this factor be measured independently? âœ“
- Does it have clear business meaning? âœ“
- Can belief dimensions be scored objectively? âœ“

**Composability Test:**
- Can this combine mathematically with other factors? âœ“
- Are interactions well-defined? âœ“
- Does temporal decay make sense? âœ“

**Predictive Test:**
- Does this factor correlate with market outcomes? [TO BE TESTED]
- Do belief dimensions improve prediction vs raw magnitude? [TO BE TESTED]
- Can this factor be validated against historical data? [TO BE TESTED]

This framework ensures every "soft" concept becomes a precise, testable, combinable mathematical component.
