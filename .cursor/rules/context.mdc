# AEIOU - News-Driven Market Prediction Engine

## What Is This?

**AEIOU** is an experimental system that goes beyond simple stock prediction to understand **how news creates investor beliefs and drives market behavior**. Instead of just predicting if a stock will go up or down, it aims to understand *why* by mapping the causal chains from:

**News Event** → **Investor Interpretation** → **Expected Business Impact** → **Stock Movement**

## The Core Innovation

Most prediction systems look for correlations in data. AEIOU tries to model the **human reasoning process** that drives markets:

- **How do investors interpret news?** (Is it believable? From a credible source?)
- **What business outcomes do they expect?** (Revenue growth? Margin expansion?)
- **How do different investor types react?** (Retail vs institutional, momentum vs fundamental)
- **When do narratives persist vs fade?** (Distinguishing hype from real value)

## Current Status: Phase 1 - Data Foundation

We're currently in **Week 1** of development, focusing on validating core assumptions:
- Can we reliably connect news timestamps to market movements?
- Do our data sources capture enough information for causal analysis?
- Are our fundamental assumptions about investor behavior testable?

## Key Documents

- **[Lean Development Strategy.md](./Lean%20Development%20Strategy.md)** - Our build-test-learn approach with phase-by-phase validation todos
- **[Research.md](./Research.md)** - 236-page comprehensive analysis of existing approaches and academic literature
- **[PRD.md](./PRD.md)** - Detailed product requirements and enhanced system vision
- **[Hypotheses.md](./Hypotheses.md)** - 7 core testable hypotheses underlying the project
- **[Plan of Action.md](./Plan%20of%20Action.md)** - High-level development roadmap

## The Vision

Rather than another black-box predictor, AEIOU aims to become an **"epistemic rating agency"** for markets - helping distinguish between:
- **Perceived Value** (market narratives and hype)
- **Proven Value** (genuine business fundamentals)

Success means building a system that not only predicts market movements but *explains* them in terms of investor psychology and causal business logic.
