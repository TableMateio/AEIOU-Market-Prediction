# Project Status Tracker - AEIOU News-Driven Market Prediction

## üéØ Current Status: **Phase 1 - Data Foundation**
**Started**: [DATE TO BE FILLED]  
**Current Week**: Week 1 - Data Reality Check  
**Overall Progress**: 0% Complete  

---

## üìä Phase Progress Overview

### ‚úÖ **Planning Phase** - COMPLETE
- [x] Project description and vision defined
- [x] Comprehensive research completed (236-page analysis)
- [x] Core concepts and assumptions documented
- [x] 7 testable hypotheses formulated
- [x] 180+ business factors catalogued
- [x] Technology stack identified
- [x] Lean development strategy created

### üîÑ **Phase 1: Data Foundation** - IN PROGRESS
**Goal**: Verify our data sources can actually support causal analysis

#### Week 1: Data Reality Check - 0% Complete
**Critical Assumption Tests**:
- [ ] **NEWS TIMING PRECISION**: Can we reliably correlate news timestamps to market movements?
- [ ] **NEWS COVERAGE COMPLETENESS**: Are we missing critical information?
- [ ] **STOCK DATA ACCURACY**: Is intraday data precise enough?

**Build Minimum**:
- [ ] Simple data ingestion script (Alpha Vantage + one backup source)
- [ ] Basic timestamp alignment between news and price data
- [ ] Manual verification dashboard for 20 events

**Success Criteria**: 
- [ ] News-to-price correlation visible in >70% of major events
- [ ] Timestamp accuracy within 30 minutes

#### Week 2: Manual Causal Chain Validation - NOT STARTED
- [ ] Manual causal chain extraction testing
- [ ] Inter-annotator agreement measurement
- [ ] Sufficient information validation

### ‚è≥ **Phase 2: NLP Pipeline** - NOT STARTED
- Week 3: GPT-4 Consistency Testing
- Week 4: Historical Pattern Validity

### ‚è≥ **Phase 3: Belief & Perception Modeling** - NOT STARTED
- Week 5-6: Believability Scoring
- Week 7: Investor Archetype Assumptions

### ‚è≥ **Phase 4: Prediction Engine** - NOT STARTED
- Week 8-9: Prediction Accuracy Testing

### ‚è≥ **Phase 5: Reflexivity & Meta-Learning** - NOT STARTED
- Week 10+: Adaptation Testing

## üéØ Current Focus

### This Week's Priority
**Week 1: Data Reality Check**

**Next Action Items**:
1. Set up Alpha Vantage API access
2. Pull 10 major Apple events from last year
3. Validate news timestamp precision
4. Check news coverage completeness for iPhone 15 launch
5. Cross-validate stock data accuracy

### Key Decisions Pending
- [ ] Choose backup data source (if Alpha Vantage insufficient)
- [ ] Define "major event" criteria for testing
- [ ] Set up development environment

## üö® Risk Monitoring

### Current Risks
- **Data Quality Unknown**: Haven't validated Alpha Vantage reliability yet
- **No API Access**: Need to set up data
