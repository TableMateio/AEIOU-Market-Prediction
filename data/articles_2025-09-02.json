    "title": "Bank of America - Coronavirus Mayhem, Historic Crash And Recovery, EV Surge And More | Fintech Zoom - World Finance",
    "body": "2020 was a year unlike any other. The stock market suffered a historic crash as the COVID-19 pandemic spread to the United States.\n\nEconomic shutdowns and a volatile presidential election couldn't keep Mr. Market down for long, as all the major indices made new all-time highs as the year drew to a close. The S&P 500 began the year trading around 3,257, crashed to 2,237 in March, and is on pace to close out the year around the 3,740 level.\n\nA look back at Fintech Zoom's most popular stories of the year paints an interesting portrait of market volatility and trader enthusiasm. Here's a look at some of our most-read stories of 2020.\n\nMcDonald's (NYSE: MCD) CEO Chris Kempczinski took over as CEO after the fast-food giant fired Stephen Easterbrook in late 2019 for violating company policy and engaging in a consensual relationship with another employee.\n\n\"We're going to be a lot better, a lot closer to where we want to be, where we aspire to be as a company,\" Kempczinski told employees.\n\nCantor Fitzgerald On Aurora Cannabis: Buy The Dip\n\nShares of Aurora Cannabis (NYSE: ACB) had dropped about 30% over the previous last month, under pressure due to analyst downgrades and \"misplaced market chatter,\" according to Cantor Fitzgerald. The stock traded around $20 per share at the time and shares currently trade at $8.72, down about 66% year-to-date.\n\nHere's How Much Investing 0 In Bank of America Stock Back In 2010 Would Be Worth Today\n\nOne market laggard of the past decade was Bank of America Corp (NYSE: (BA)C). Bank of America and other U.S. banks were hit hard during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. Among the big banks that survived the crisis, Bank of America was one of the hardest hit. At one point in 2009, Bank of America's share price dropped as low as $2.53 on fears it might not survive.\n\nJan. 26: Kobe Bryant and his daughter Gianna were among nine people in a helicopter that crashed in California. There were no survivors. The N(BA) legend played 20 years for the Los Angeles Lakers and won five N(BA) championships.\n\nIt's safe to say the electric vehicle space provided the biggest \"story stock\" run of the year, best exemplified by industry stalwart Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: (TSLA)). Longtime bull Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Investment Management, slapped a $7,000 price target on the stock on Feb. 1, which drew plenty of cheers and jeers. With Tesla shares up 700% year-to-date, Wood may be getting the last laugh.\n\nTesla Model 3 Teardown Finds Technology Years Ahead Of Established Automakers\n\nTesla's core computing technology, which will allow autonomous operation, is \"far ahead\" of other carmakers' computing, according to a \"tear-down\" of the vehicle and review by Nikkei Asian Review. No wonder the stock has outperformed the entire auto industry.\n\nApple Demands To Stop Publication Of Book Written By Employee Because It Allegedly Reveals Company Secrets\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) lawyers initiated legal action against a former employee for allegedly violating his terms of employment. Tom Sadowski published a book called \"App Store Confidential\" that the consumer electronics giant believes reveals confidential information that Sadowski wasn't supposed to disclose as part of his employment contract.\n\nMarch\n\nCoronavirus Checklist: What You'll Need To Have At Home In Case Of Quarantine\n\nWhat should you have in your home emergency kit in case of a quarantine? The question was at top of mind in early March, as the COVID-19 coronavirus started making its way to all corners of the country.\n\nSo-Called 'MAGA' Stocks Lose T Market Value In A Single Day\n\nThe continued spread of the novel coronavirus has affected the economic activity in the country, with citizens being advised to avoid non-essential social gatherings.\n\nThe drop in the value of \"MAGA\" stocks on March 17 came as the Nasdaq dropped more than 12%. Others, including Dow Jones and S&P 500, suffered similar losses in what was the worst single-day performance since October 1987.\n\nCruise Line Analyst Jumps Ship On Norwegian Cruise, Royal Caribbean Amid Coronavirus Cancellations\n\nCarnival Corp (NYSE: CCL), Royal Caribbean Cruises (NYSE: RCL) and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NYSE: NCLH) had their businesses completely upended by the pandemic. The service suspensions -- and the long-term impact on consumer trust -- could prove painful, according to (BofA) Securities.\n\nBy (BofA)'s assessment, demand could take several years to recover. Net yields took three years to return to pre-Sept. 11 levels and about eight years to return to pre-Great Recession levels.\n\nBack in mid-April, the enrollment of participants for the highest dose arm was underway in the Phase 1 study of mRNA-1273, its vaccine candidate for the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The vaccine received emergency use authorization from the FDA on Dec. 18.\n\nBill Gates, Backer of Inovio And Six Others, Says Coronavirus Vaccine Could Be Mass Produced Within A Year\n\n\"If everything went perfectly, we'd be in scale manufacturing within a year,\" Bill Gates told Fintech Zoom's Fareed Zakaria. \"It could be as long as two years.\" In December, millions of vaccine doses from Moderna and Pfizer were distributed.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) CEO Warren Buffett is one of the most successful and well-respected investors of all time, and Tesla is one of the most controversial investments on Wall Street these days. So when Buffett recently sat down with Yahoo Finance for an interview, it's only natural that editor-in-chief Andy Serwer would ask Buffett about Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk.\n\nStudy: Cannabis Could Prevent COVID-19 Infections\n\nA study published in the journal Preprints, which is not peer-reviewed, found certain marijuana strains could prevent the spread and severity of COVID-19. It's all tied to how the coronavirus is transmitted between patients.\n\nLike most respiratory illnesses, tiny droplets carrying the disease expelled by coughing or sneezing go airborne. Once a non-infected patient inhales those droplets, it typically enters your body through cells in your lungs and corresponding tissue.\n\nJune\n\nCitron On Genius Brands: 'The Lowest Form Of Retail Investor'\n\nGenius Brands International (NASDAQ: GNUS) surged more than 2,850% since May on news of operational improvements and investments. The children's entertainment company announced it would merge its \"Kid Genius Cartoon Channel\" and \"Baby Genius TV\" into a digital network. CEO Andy Heyward called it a free \"Netflix for kids\" and, in an appeal to today's parents, an \"economic vaccine for COVID-19.\"\n\nTo Citron Research, the developments didn't warrant the dramatic price surge. It wouldn't be the last time we heard from the notorious short seller.\n\nWhat's Behind The Rally In Luckin Coffee?\n\nScandal-stained Luckin Coffee saw its shares slump to a low of $1.33 on delisting risk but saw strong momentum this particular week. The spike may have been due to bargain hunting amid the stock's plunge. With bargain hunters picking up the stock, some of the short bets may have unwound, creating additional strength.\n\nTesla Demonstrates Why Short Selling Is So Much More Dangerous Than Going Long\n\nTesla had the single largest short position of any U.S. stock. And while short sellers still pound the table on how detached the stock has come from reality, Tesla is a textbook example of how much more dangerous it is for traders to short a stock than go long.\n\nWorkhorse CFO On Meteoric Stock Rise, Electric Delivery Vehicle Maker's Capital Plans\n\nWorkhorse Group (NASDAQ: WKHS) is an electric truck manufacturer. The stock exploded in June, spending the first half of the year trading under $4 a share and the second half of the year trading between $17 and $30. CFO Steve Schrader spoke with Fintech Zoom about Workhorse's valuation, its financing and its place in the market.\n\nCongress Allows Troops To Use CBD Products\n\nMilitary service members are no longer forbidden to use CBD products. The House of Representatives approved a measure that allows troops to use hemp products as well as its derivatives.\n\nThe measure passed by a vote of 336 to 71 and the initiative was led by Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who is also a military veteran. It specifies that the Secretary of Defense may not prohibit \"the possession, use, or consumption\" of hemp or hemp-derived product to a \"member of the Armed Forces\" as long as the crop meets federal standards.\n\nAugust\n\nTortoise Acquisition Corp. II Files For IPO: What You Need to Know\n\nThe popularity of this news item was just a microcosm of the SPAC (specialty purpose acquisition company) explosion this year. A SPAC is a company with no commercial operations formed to raise capital through an initial public offering for the purpose of acquiring an existing company.\n\n219 \"blank-check\" companies raised $73 billion in proceeds in 2020. The 462% year-over-year rise raised by SPACs this year outpaced traditional IPOs, which raised $67 billion year-to-date.\n\nDue to their popularity, Fintech Zoom launched a daily \"SPACS Attack\" show on YouTube.\n\nOne day after Tesla's 5-for-1 stock split took effect, the electric vehicle manufacturer announced a $5-billion at-the-market offering. The move came amid the stock's massive rise in value, as well as the company's ongoing efforts to construct new Gigafactories in Texas and Germany.\n\nTesla Chinese Rivals Not Losing Sleep Over Planned K Electric Vehicle\n\nTesla's Chinese peers didn't see the company's plan to bring out a $25,000 electric vehicle as a cause of major concern. Tesla had said it aims to produce a $25,000 fully autonomous electric car within three years at its battery day event.\n\nXpeng Inc's (NASDAQ: XPEV) Vice Chairman Brian Gu said the company's mid-range EVs are already priced around the $25,000 mark and if Tesla raises its Shanghai plant's output to 1 million vehicles annually, it \"means the market has grown so much faster and bigger than what we anticipated.\"\n\nSept. 18: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died following complications from pancreatic cancer. At 87 years old, Ginsburg had served on the court for 27 years.\n\nHertz Global shares spiked sharply higher after the company announced it secured commitments of $1.65 billion in debtor-in-possession financing. On May 22, Hertz filed for bankruptcy protection amid $19 billion in debt and 700,000 idle rental cars due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The stock currently trades under $2 on the OTC market.\n\nRevisiting Nio's Dream Run This Week\n\nNio Inc (NYSE: NIO), one of the year's best performers, had a strong run in its share price this particular week. The Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer was on the cusp of capitalizing on a slew of initiatives it has undertaken to push vehicle sales higher and bring about cost discipline.\n\nNovember\n\nCan These 2 Hot Stocks Continue To Rise In November?\n\nShares of Kate Spade and Coach parent company Tapestry Inc (NYSE: TPR) notched a strong return in October. Meanwhile, shares of General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) rallied 20% throughout October after a few months of softness. Both stocks continued to trade higher throughout the last two months of the year.\n\nCitron Pulls Plug On Nio, Says Valuation 'Can Never Be Justified'\n\nBack in November 2018, Citron Research's Andrew Left compared Nio to Tesla when the former was trading at around $7 per share. At the time of this story, Nio shares traded at $53.\n\n\"After a rocky road of trading, NIO has found itself in unchartered territory that can never be justified by its current standing in the China EV market or its near-term prospects,\" Left wrote in a report, which was Fintech Zoom's most-read story of the entire year.\n\nA GameStop manager reportedly shared a company email sent to the store minutes before the public announcement that indicated the location would have 15 new consoles available for pre-order. However, minutes after the announcement, a crowd of 40 appeared at the store, violating social distancing norms.\n\nElon Musk Calls Bitcoin 'BS' In Tawdry Tweet, Causes 20% Dogecoin Surge\n\nYep, Elon Musk was back at it again in the final month of the year. The Tesla and SpaceX founder has a history of poking fun at cryptocurrencies.\n\nA headline that perfectly captures life in 2020. Actor and well-known stoner Seth Rogen has said, \"I smoke weed all day and every day and have for 20 years. For me, it's like glasses or shoes.\" But is smoking weed every day a good idea? If so, what actually happens?\n\nSee more from Fintech Zoom",

    "title": "FB Stock Still Is the Best Investment in the Metaverse Out There",
    "body": "Facebook Inc. did more than a simple name change when it took on the Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:FB) moniker. It also put an emerging trend (the metaverse) on the map. Doing so didn't give FB stock much of a boost.\n\nIt did help spark enthusiasm for several more speculative cryptos and stocks, as you are likely aware.\n\nFor example, \"metacoins\" like Decentraland (CCC:MANA-USD), as well as stocks such as Matterport (NASDAQ:MTTR).\n\nNimble traders were able to book fast profits trading this trend via such vehicles. Other investors had less luck, as seen from their big declines after the meta trade peaked in November.\n\nWith this, you're likely better off not chasing the chancier meta plays at this time.\n\nInstead, going long the social media giant may be the best vehicle for metaverse exposure.\n\nThis isn't the only big tech stock out there with a meta catalyst. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have also been discussed by analysts as possible metaverse plays.\n\nStill, even if this company fails to dominate the metaverse, consider it the better play. Why? Let's dive in and find out.\n\nAs I mentioned above, the metaverse has yet to help send shares in Meta Platforms higher. Admittedly, other factors have played a role in this.\n\nThe worries over the Fed's hawkish moves and the omicron variant, for one. Along with this, per my InvestorPlace colleague Dana Blankenhorn, the company's numerous controversies have weighed down on it as well.\n\nThat said, based on recent headlines, the metaverse catalyst may be on the verge of finally putting points into FB stock.\n\nAs analysts from KeyBanc discussed in a recent research note, the rise in popularity of the Oculus app over the Christmas weekend may signal its headsets were a popular gift this holiday season.\n\nNews of this helped to give Meta shares a 3.26% pop the day it was announced. Although not exactly a \"needle mover,\" it may be a sign that this trend will start to have a positive impact on its near-term price performance.\n\nThat's good news for investors, who have likely been frustrated as the company's big tech peers, like Apple and Microsoft, have performed much better than this name in recent months.\n\nBut that's not all. Over the long-term, this trend is more likely to have a material impact on this stock, than it will on the price of the above-mentioned names also perceived to have high exposure to it.\n\nName change notwithstanding, I'll admit it's not set in stone that Meta Platforms will dominate the metaverse hardware business.\n\nMany have made the case why Apple stands to win the metaverse hardware wars. That said, even if it does not become the largest name in the hardware end of this space, this trend could still have a greater long-term impact on its stock price for two reasons.\n\nFirst, it's making a much more concentrated bet on the trend than its rivals, with efforts related to both the hardware and software ends of this digital frontier.\n\nThat may be riskier, yet it offers much more upside potential in the event the metaverse truly becomes the next big thing.\n\nSecond, FB stock trades at a much more reasonable valuation than either AAPL stock or MSFT stock.\n\nAt today's prices, Meta Platforms trades for 24.8x forward earnings. Apple's earnings multiple is 31.6x, and Microsoft's is 37.2x.\n\nI'll concede much of this has to do with low analyst expectations when it comes to the company's 2022 earnings growth. Consensus calls for earnings per share (EPS) growth of just 2% next year.\n\nIn contrast, Apple and Microsoft are both expected to see double-digit percentage annual earnings growth.\n\nHowever, between it beating consensus four quarters in a row, analysts may be underestimating how well the company will perform in the quarters ahead.\n\nWith the high end of estimates calling for EPS of $16.70 in 2022 (nearly 20% above 2021 estimates), Meta Platforms could surprise.\n\nInvestors and traders have dabbled in riskier metaverse cryptos/stocks over the past two months. Those early to the trend likely realized fast profits.\n\nUnfortunately, investors a little late to the game may be sitting underwater, after the pullback seen with these more volatile plays.\n\nTo play this trend, making a long-term wager looks to be the best move. Between Meta Platforms, Apple, and Microsoft, you have plenty of options. Yet among the three, there's one that's the best one, all things considered.\n\nIf placing bets on the metaverse, go with FB stock. It offers greater exposure to the trend than its peers, as well as a lower valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

    "title": "What Does 2022 Have In Store For Apple Stock?",
    "body": "Apple stock (NASDAQ: AAPL) had a solid 2021, rallying by almost 39% year-to-date, trading at all-time highs of about $180 per share, valuing the company at close to $3 trillion. This compares to the S&P 500 which remains up by about 29% year-to-date. While Apple's reputation as a safe-haven stock has attracted investors through the pandemic, its financial performance has also been stellar. Sales rose by about 33% over the fiscal year ended September 2021, and EPS grew by almost 71%, driven by strong demand for the flagship 5G iPhones and computing products, such as the iPad and Mac. Apple has also navigated the ongoing chip shortage much better compared to other tech companies. Investors also appear to be enthusiastic following reports of Apple's potential new products, which could include an augmented reality headset and a self-driving car. So what does 2022 have in store for Apple stock?\n\nApple's revenue growth rate is likely to cool considerably through FY'22. The big remote working and learning-related surge in demand for computing products such as iPads and Macs is likely to abate this year and there have been reports that demand for iPhone 13 - which is seen as an incremental update over last year's iPhone 12 - is also slowing. Moreover, on the macro front, the picture could be clouded by the Federal Reserves' increasingly hawkish stance and outlook for as many as three interest rate hikes over the next year. Apple's P/E multiple remains elevated versus historical levels, potentially making the stock more sensitive to rate hikes. Apple trades at about 30x our projected 2022 EPS, up from just about 11x in 2016 and around 22x in 2019. We value Apple stock at about $159 per share, marking a discount of about 11% from the current market price. See our analysis on Apple Valuation: Is AAPL Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for an overview of what's driving our price estimate for Apple.\n\nBelow you'll find our previous coverage of Apple stock where you can track our view over time.\n\n[11/4/2021] Apple Stock Holds Up Despite Supply Issues. Is It A Buy?\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is beginning to see the impact of the ongoing semiconductor shortage, as it posted a rare revenue miss for Q4 FY'21 due to a weaker supply of chips and manufacturing challenges due to Covid-19. Apple also warned that supply could remain constrained through the all-important holiday quarter. However, unlike other companies that have seen big sell-offs following revenue shortfalls and news of supply chain-related issues, Apple stock has largely held up, declining by just about 2% since its earnings report last week.\n\nApple is clearly in a much better position to navigate the ongoing headwinds compared to other smartphone players. Apple is the most profitable company in the smartphone space by far, with gross margins standing at a solid 42% in Q4 FY'21. This means the company should be in a better position to pay more to secure supply, compared to smaller players, without really impacting its profits. Moreover, Apple appears to have planned for a big iPhone cycle ahead of the chip issues, with Bloomberg previously reporting that the company was looking at a 20% bump in iPhone 13 production over its initial production run for last year's flagships iPhone 12. This could mean that Apple will see reasonable supply growth despite shortages. Demand should also hold up, as carrier promos for the new devices also appear attractive, as wireless carriers look to sign on customers for their recently built out 5G networks. Stronger momentum in the iPhone business is always a big catalyst for Apple stock, and this could be validated as Apple publishes Q1 FY'22 earnings.\n\nWe value Apple at about $159 per share, about 7% ahead of the market price. See our analysis on Apple Valuation: Is AAPL Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for an overview of what's driving our price estimate for Apple.\n\n[10/25/2021] What To Expect From Apple's Q4 Earnings?\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to publish its Q4 FY'21 results on Thursday, October 28. We expect Apple's revenues to come in at about $83 billion, marking an increase of about 28.5% year-over-year. EPS is likely to stand at $1.18 per share, an increase of about 57% compared to last year. Our revenue estimates are in line with consensus estimates, while our EPS estimate is slightly below the consensus.\n\nSo what are the key trends that are likely to drive Apple's results? While Apple launched its latest iPhone 13 handsets in September, we don't expect the device to be a major driver of Apple's sales, as it was available for sale for just about a week in Q3. That said, we expect revenues to still see a solid year-over-year increase, driven by strong sales of the iPhone 12, higher demand for iPads and Macs as the remote learning and working trend persists, and continued growth in the services segment. However, it's possible that Apple could be seeing some pressure on device supply, due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. Apple's margins are also likely to trend higher on a year-over-year basis, driven by a growing mix of services revenues, higher average prices on iPhones, and other devices. See our interactive dashboard analysis on Apple Pre-Earnings for more details.\n\nAlthough Apple stock has gained about 15% year-to-date, this was underperforming the broader S&P 500 which was up by about 22% over the same period. The underperformance comes as investors rotated out of pandemic winners such as tech and work from home stocks, to more cyclical and value stocks to play the re-opening. Moreover, investors are likely concerned that Apple's big iPhone 13 upgrade cycle could see some pressure due to the semiconductor shortage. However, if Apple manages to post a reasonably strong earnings beat in Q4, we could see the stock move higher from current levels. We value Apple stock at about $161 per share, about 8% ahead of the current market price. See our analysis on Apple Valuation: Is AAPL Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for an overview of what's driving our price estimate for Apple.\n\n[7/28/2021] Why Apple Stock Has Further Upside\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a record set of Q3 FY'21 results, with revenue surging almost 36% year-over-year to $81.4 billion and earnings per share rising to $1.30, up from around $0.65 last year, as Apple's 5G iPhones continued to witness strong demand, while its other products, including the Mac and iPad, saw continued traction driven by the work and learn from anywhere trend. Apple also posted one of its thickest gross margins, at a little over 43%, up from just about 38% in the same quarter last year, driven by a more favorable sales mix and higher services revenues. However, Apple stock was actually down by about 2% in after-hours trading, as Apple warned that the global semiconductor shortage could impact sales of its iPhones and iPads over the current quarter.\n\nAlthough Apple stock trades at $144 per share, close to its all-time highs, with its forward P/E multiple standing at close to 29x, compared to a 5-year average multiple of just about 20x, we still remain bullish. We have increased our Apple price estimate to $157 per share, up from $147 previously, marking a premium of about 9% over the current market price. See our analysis on Apple Valuation: Is AAPL Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for an overview of what's driving our price estimate for Apple.\n\nWe think the semiconductor shortage is only likely to have a transitory impact on Apple, and believe that the company should see further upside from its iPhone franchise, with upgraded models around the corner and also from its fast-growing and highly lucrative services business. Apple also appears to be getting more Android customers to migrate to its ecosystem, noting that it saw strong double-digit growth in the number of people who switched in Q3. This is significantly positive, as Apple has done a good job locking in users and better monetizing them with pricier upgrades, new products, and services. While continued revenue growth and solid margin expansion should drive Apple's profits, shareholder returns could be magnified by Apple's massive stock buyback program. For perspective, the company has bought back an average of 5% of its stock each year over the last five years.\n\n[7/20/2021] What To Expect From Apple's Q3?\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to publish its Q3 FY'21 results on July 27. We expect Apple's Revenues to come in at about $72.5 billion, marking an increase of about 21% year-over-year. EPS is likely to stand at about $1 per share, an increase of about 47% compared to last year. Our revenue estimates are slightly below consensus while our EPS estimate is in line with consensus.\n\nSo what are the key trends that are likely to drive Apple's results? Revenues should see a nice bump year-over-year, driven by strong sales of the iPhone 12, higher demand for iPads and Macs as the remote learning and working trend persists, and continued growth in the services segment. However, Apple typically sees a seasonal decline in sales in Q3 and the company has noted that the drop this quarter could be a bit steeper, due to supply chain-related issues and the slightly delayed launch of the flagship iPhones. Apple's margins are also likely to trend higher on a year-over-year basis, driven by a growing mix of services revenues, higher average prices on iPhones, and possibly by a favorable forex environment. See our interactive dashboard analysis on Apple's pre-earnings: What To Expect in FY'Q3? for more details.\n\nAlthough Apple stock has rallied by almost 50% over the last 12 months, it has underperformed year-to-date, rising by just about 13% versus the S&P 500 which was up by almost 17%. The underperformance comes as investors rotated out of pandemic winners such as tech stocks, to more cyclical and value stocks to play the re-opening. Apple, which trades at almost 30x forward earnings, which is above historical levels, has been impacted to a certain extent. That said, if Apple manages to post a solid earnings beat in Q3, we could see the stock gain further.\n\n[4/29/2021] Why Are Apple's Margins Surging?\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a strong set of Q2 FY'21 results, with revenue surging almost 54% year-over-year to about $90 billion and earnings per share rising to $1.40, up from around $0.64 last year, driven by higher sales of the iPhone, digital services, as well as iPads and Macs. Apple's gross margins expanded by a remarkable 420 basis points year over year to 42.5%, reaching their highest levels in almost nine years. So what's driving Apple's surging margins and can they hold up?\n\nThe new iPhone 12 handsets saw their first full quarter of sales over Q2 FY'21, helping iPhone revenue rise 65% compared to last year. The iPhone is Apple's most profitable hardware product and the new handset is also priced at a premium compared to its predecessors, helping margins. Apple's services business also had a solid quarter, with sales growing by about 26% compared to last year, with services gross margins rising to 70% from about 65% last year, driven by a more favorable revenue mix, likely skewed toward more commission generating businesses such as apps and third-party subscriptions. For example, Apple says that it has about 660 million paid subscriptions on its platform now, marking an increase of 145 million compared to last year. Separately, Apple said that it also benefited from a favorable foreign exchange environment.\n\nSo how will Apple's margins trend in the long run? The company has guided margins of between 41.5% and 42.5% for Q3, which is reasonably high, considering that FY'Q3 is typically a seasonally weaker quarter compared to FY'Q2. Moreover, Apple expects to see some semiconductor supply constraints for its Macs and iPads over the next quarter, likely putting some pressure on margins.\n\nThink Apple stock is pricey at current levels, but still want to play the upside in iPhone sales? Check out our theme on Apple Component Supplier Stocks - which includes a diverse set of companies that supply components for iPhones, iPads, and other Apple devices.\n\n[4/16/2021] Apple's Q2 Earnings Preview\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to publish its Q2 FY'21 results on April 28. We expect Apple's Revenues to come in at about $76.6 billion, marking an increase of about 31% year-over-year. EPS is likely to stand at about $0.97 per share, an increase of about 51% compared to last year. Our revenue estimates are roughly in line with consensus while our EPS estimate is marginally below consensus. So what are the key trends that are likely to drive Apple's results? Revenues should see a nice bump year-over-year driven by the higher-priced iPhone 12 handsets - which will see their first full quarter of availability. Higher demand for computing products such as Macs and iPads and stronger growth in the services business is also likely to drive Apple's top line. Moreover, Apple will see a favorable comparison with Q2 FY'20 when sales were impacted by the first set of Covid-19 related lockdowns. Apple's margins could also trend higher, driven by a growing mix of services revenues and higher average prices on iPhones, although the supply crunch in the semiconductor market could put some pressure on the company. See our interactive dashboard analysis on Apple's pre-earnings: What To Expect in Q1? for more details.\n\nApple stock has rallied by almost 90% over the last 12 months, driven by growing demand for consumer electronics through Covid-19, anticipation surrounding the 5G iPhones, and Apple's position as a \"safe haven\" stock. The stock now trades at roughly 30x forward EPS, which is higher compared to historical levels. It's very likely that Apple's Q2 results will determine the near-term trajectory for Apple's stock.\n\n[2/2/2021] What's Driving Apple's Expanding Margins?\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had a solid Q1 FY'21, posting record Revenues that topped $110 billion led by the new 5G iPhones. Apple's Operating Margins also soared by a remarkable 220 basis points year over year to about 30.1%. Can Apple sustain these margins going forward? Let's take a closer look at what drove Apple's Products and Services Gross Margins and Operating Expenses to find out.\n\nApple's Product Gross Margins, or the profits it makes after accounting for direct costs related to making its iDevices, computers, and accessories, rose by around 90 basis points year over year to 35.1%. Although we actually expected margins to face pressure on account of higher costs relating to 5G components on the new iPhones, Apple significantly beat our margin expectations, driven by a couple of factors. Firstly, Apple has a certain level of fixed costs in its product cost structures and with the product Revenue soaring by about 21%, it benefited from some leverage gains. Secondly, Apple's product mix has been more favorable than previous quarters, with Apple nudging customers towards \"Pro\" versions of its devices, which likely have thicker margins. In fact, Apple raised the price of its iPhone 12 versus last year's iPhone 11, making its iPhone 12 Pro models (priced at $1,000 and up) look like better value compared to last year.\n\nApple's Services business also saw Gross Margins soar to around 68.4%, an increase of around 400 basis points versus last year. Services Revenue grew by a strong 24% year-over-year, likely enabling better-fixed cost absorption. Apple also likely saw a large percentage of commission-driven revenues such as App sales and subscriptions, which are much more profitable. Apple's operating expenses rose by just about 12% year-over-year compared to total Revenues which expanded by 21% and this was also a factor that drove its Operating Margin gains, in addition to the Gross Profit gains.\n\nOur dashboard Breaking Down Apple's Services Revenue estimates the revenue figures for AppStore, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, Third-party Subscriptions, Licensing, Apple Care, and Apple Pay.\n\nSo can Apple sustain margins at these levels? We think so. Apple's 2021 Revenues are projected to jump by a solid 21%, per consensus estimates, likely growing faster than Apple's cost base. Moreover, the full impact of the new iPhone 12 is only likely to be seen in the coming quarters, as production picks up and the devices see full quarters of availability. For perspective, the device went on sale only about 3 to 4 weeks into Q1'FY21, with popular models remaining short-supplied.\n\n[1/25/2021] Will The iPhone 12 Deliver For Apple?\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is slated to publish its Q1 FY'21 earnings on January 27, reporting on a quarter that saw the launch of its much anticipated 5G iPhone 12. We expect Revenues to come in at about $100 billion for the quarter, growing by about 9% versus last year, with EPS likely to grow by about 7% to around $1.35 per share. Our estimates are marginally below the consensus. So what are the key trends that are likely to drive earnings? Firstly, Revenues should see a bump driven by strong demand for the 5G iPhones, which saw multiple models remain back-ordered through the holidays. Apple should also see higher average selling prices for the iconic smartphone, as it raised base pricing on the iPhone 12 versus the iPhone 11, while nudging customers toward the more premium iPhone Pro models (priced at $1,000 and up), which appear to be a better value compared to last year. Apple's Services business is also likely to have had its strongest quarter yet, driven by the App Store. In fact, Apple provided a data point indicating that between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, a total of $1.8 billion was spent on apps, up 27% versus last year. App sales growth over the same period last year was about 16%. That said, Apple's margins could see some pressure, as the new iPhones are likely to be more expensive to produce compared to last year as 5G components are pricier.\n\nApple stock has rallied by about 65% over the last 12 months, driven largely by anticipation surrounding the 5G iPhones. Apple stock now trades at 33x projected EPS, making it look pricey compared to historical levels. The Q1 FY'21 earnings should give investors a good sense of how the device is faring and could be key to Apple's stock trajectory in the near-term. See our pre-earnings analysis Apple Earnings Preview: Will Apple Beat Expectations? for more details on Apple's recent performance and what's driving its valuation.\n\n[12/9/2020] Apple's Services Will Overtake The iPhone By 2024\n\nApple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Services business is likely to emerge as its most profitable (and valuable) business within the next four years, likely eclipsing even the iPhone - which is seen as one of the most lucrative consumer products of all time. Here's how we expect this to play out. We expect Services sales to grow at a rate of about 11% a year (down from a rate of 22% each year over the last 4 years) to $81.5 billion in FY'24, driven by the continued growth of the AppStore and subscription services. On the other hand, we expect iPhone Revenues to grow at an average rate of about 5% each year over the next four years to about $167 billion (iPhone Revenue remained almost flat between 2016 and 2020). Now Apple's services have much thicker margins compared to hardware products. Over FY'20, Apple's product Gross Margins stood at 31.5% versus about 66% for Services. If we assume that margins remain flat at current levels, Services Gross Profits would stand at about $54 billion in FY'24, compared to about $53 billion for the iPhone. In fact, Operating Profits could actually be much higher for Services, considering that much of Apple's Services sales come via commissions, with little marketing or development expenses involved.\n\nOur dashboard Breaking Down Apple's Services Revenue estimates the revenue figures for AppStore, Apple Music, Apple TV+, iCloud, Third-party Subscriptions, Licensing, Apple Care, and Apple Pay.\n\nHowever, there are a few caveats. Firstly, Apple's Service business is quite dependent on fees Google pays Apple for being the default search engine on its iDevices (an estimated 20% of Services Revenue, and a larger percentage of profits). There's a possibility that the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust lawsuit against Google could jeopardize these payments, hurting Apple's services growth. Secondly, Apple is increasingly investing in content production with services such as AppleTV+ and these offerings could also have lower margins.\n\nSo what does this mean for Apple stock? Internet services-led companies have typically commanded higher valuation multiples compared to hardware plays on account of their thicker margins, and associated platform-related lock-ins. However, in Apple's case, this is likely already baked into its valuation. Apple's trailing P/E multiple has soared and almost doubled over the past year to levels of around 38x currently - which is in line with other Internet players such as Alphabet.\n\n[Updated 11/23/2020] What's The Impact Of The AppStore Commission Cut?\n\nLast week, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) indicated that it would be cutting its commissions on app sales and in-app purchases from 30% to 15% for smaller developers, who earn less than $1 million annually from the AppStore. Apple has been facing significant criticism that its AppStore practices hurt smaller developers and tech giants, including Apple, face increasing scrutiny from regulators regarding their market power. This move should help Apple's image to a large extent. App analytics company Sensor Tower estimates that about 98% of the developers that pay Apple commissions will benefit.\n\nHowever, will reducing commissions by half impact the performance of Apple's highly lucrative and fast-growing Services business? After all, the AppStore is estimated to account for roughly a third of Apple's Services Revenue. Not really. Apple earns a bulk of its AppStore revenue from the largest developers, with Sensor Tower indicating that developers who benefit from this program accounted for under 5% of App Store revenues last year. Moreover, the discounted fee will only apply until developers cross the $1 million threshold, after which Apple will bill them at the higher 30% commission rate.\n\n[Updated 8/17/2020] How The Epic Lawsuit Impacts Apple\n\nLast week, Epic Games sued Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for antitrust violations, after its popular Fortnite game was removed from the AppStore shortly after Epic let players bypass Apple's in-app purchase system, avoiding the 30% commission on sales. Although Apple has had spats with developers in the past, the Epic lawsuit is noteworthy for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the Epic lawsuit comes at a time when tech giants, including Apple, have been facing increasing scrutiny from regulators regarding their market power. Secondly, Apple is more dependent on its Services business than ever before, with hardware growth slowing (profits from Services grew 5x as fast as hardware profits over the first three-quarters of FY'20), and Epic's lawsuit targets Apple's commissions, which we estimate are Apple's single most profitable revenue stream.\n\nApple made roughly about $360 million in commissions from Fortnite over the last two years per Sensor Tower - a relative drop in the bucket for Apple which pulled in $260 billion-plus in revenues last year. However, if Epic sees a favorable judgment, and if Apple is forced to reduce its commissions or change the terms of its AppStore, this is very likely to set a precedent, causing other developers to demand similar terms.\n\nSo what could be the financial impact of Apple reducing commissions across the board? Apple takes a 30% cut on App sales and subscriptions (15% from the second year of subscriptions) and we estimate that total commission revenues stood at almost $20 billion in FY'19 (out of a total of about $46 billion in Services Revenue). If Apple reduced commissions to say 20% from 30%, it would reduced total commissions by about $7 billion to roughly $13 billion. Although the revenue impact would be limited for Apple (under 3% of Apple's Total Revenue) the impact on profits would be more pronounced given that commissions are likely to be almost entirely profit. We estimate that Apple's Operating Income would be about 10% lower if commissions were reduced, considering Apple posted about $64 billion in Operating Income in FY'19.\n\nNow commissions of 30% are actually pretty standard across the industry - Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google, which also faces a similar lawsuit from Epic, as well as Microsoft and Amazon, charge roughly the same fees on app sales on their respective market places. However, Apple has the most to lose from this given the sheer scale of its business. AppStore revenues are roughly twice as large as Google's Playstore.\n\nWhat if you're looking for a more balanced portfolio instead? Here's a high-quality portfolio that's beaten the market consistently since the end of 2016.",

    "title": "Anatomy of a 10-Bagger",
    "body": "This is (apparently) a success story. But it's more about luck than investment skills. It's the story of how I accidentally ended up with a 10-bagger in my portfolio.\n\nExactly eight years ago, in December 2013, I bought some Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock (it amounted to around 10% of my portfolio at that time) at around $72 per share. Adjusted for the recent four-for-one stock split, that is equivalent to a cost of $18 per share.\n\nI never sold those shares (well, most of them), and they nicely compounded at a yearly rate of more than 30%. Even if this can sound amazing, the reality is that I did it by mistake. Calling such an outstanding investment result a mistake can sound quite odd, but that's what it is. My choices can in theory be considered impeccable, but the reasons that lead me to apply such a behavior were far away from being based on a well-thought investment process.\n\nBefore I delve into those reasons, and in order to explain what I think a sound investment framework should look like, I will refer to Terry Smith's well-known mantra:\n\n1. Buy shares in good companies\n\n2. Don't overpay\n\n3. Do nothing\n\nOnly recently did I realize that I had unconsciously applied the above-mentioned investment principles, which is why I could reach such a surprisingly good result. Let's now analyze them one by one to see how I applied them and why.\n\nBuy shares in good companies\n\nEven if Apple was already an outstanding company eight years ago, I probably didn't really understand what a good company looked like back then and especially how good Apple was. As an engineer, I was heavily influenced by the technical aspects of the business (both as a user of their products and the knowledge acquired by working in this sector for many years), but I knew almost nothing about strategy and competitive advantages, so I was sort of half-blind.\n\nAs I today know, a company with a great product is not necessarily a great company. Technical competence and quality are paramount to capture your customers' interest (and Apple surely did it), but it is only when the value of your product/service becomes 'indispensable' for the customer that competitive advantages emerge, and there are only a few companies out there enjoying such moats that can consequently produce above-average profits for a very long time.\n\nThis means that a few years before, by following the same approach, I could have picked, for example, a company like Nokia, completely ignoring the fact that they not only possessed a tiny moat, but also that the moat was being rapidly eroded by competitors.\n\nThe high margins Apple enjoys today on their top-selling devices will come down eventually, but they are already delivering on what will provide profits and high margins for many years to come: their service business (App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, etc.). Service revenues were not significant a few years ago, but today they constitute around 22% of revenues (from the last quarter's results). That is what happens when you build a powerful ecosystem like Apple did: people won't easily jump to another one, they will stick to it.\n\nGood companies, in Terry Smith's idea, are not the ones that are thriving today, but the ones that can continue to do so for many years to come.\n\nDon't overpay\n\nBack in 2013, saying that my valuation skills were poor would have been an understatement. I could barely look at the price-earnings ratio and a few other indicators to try to determine if a stock was undervalued or not. I was a \"deep value\" investor, but without really knowing what that actually meant. I could not run a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, let alone break down a business in its parts, analyze them and make future assumptions.\n\nSo I was, again, lucky to buy Apple mostly basing my \"analysis\" on the value of a few indicators. As you can see, the price-earnings ratio at the end of the 2013 fiscal year was 12 - it even looked too high to me at that time!\n\nToday, Apple's price-earnings ratio is around 32. Is the company too expensive? The right answer is always: it depends. But for sure, Apple's multiple expansion is well deserved. The investing community now understands the company's potential, its competitive advantages and how hard it will be for its competitors to erode or destroy them.\n\nThe multiple expansion is only responsible for a 2.6 times price increase. The rest is due to Apple's earnings growth, as well as high ROIC and reinvestment rates and stock repurchases. If we add dividend returns (and growth), especially in the case an investor would have reinvested the dividends, the returns would have been even more compelling.\n\nDo nothing\n\nWhen I first bought Apple stock, I could not imagine that I would still hold it after eight years. My portfolio turnaround was quite high back then, so my investment horizon was way shorter than it is today. The only reason why I managed to hold on for such a long time was the incredible rate of stock repurchases (I have been joking with my wife that one day someone will take the company private and while scooping up the last remaining shares, will have to call me asking to sell them mine).\n\nIn 2013 alone, the company bought back the equivalent of $23 billon in stock (and, on average, it kept increasing that amount over time). Was this a good reason to hold on? Well, it was not enough. The investment landscape is full of companies squandering their hard-earned capital on stock repurchases in order to push up their stock prices (they want to gain investors' confidence and signal to the market that the stock price has a \"floor\").\n\nBut, as Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) explained multiple times, \"If youre repurchasing shares above a rationally calculated intrinsic value, you are harming shareholders.\"\n\nThat was clearly not the case for Apple. But here's the issue: as I could not calculate Apple's intrinsic value (or better, a range of potential intrinsic values), I couldn't know if the company's stock repurchases were actually beneficial or not. I was just lucky to have Tim Cook and Luca Maestri invest that money for me for the last eight years; I could not hope for better capital allocators.\n\nConclusions\n\nMy Apple investment turned out to be very successful. We're not going to have more than a few 10-baggers in our investment life (in the best case). I bought a great company at a very good price and kept it in my portfolio for many years, but I did it for the wrong reasons.\n\nWe should learn from our mistakes, but we should not judge them from their outcomes. In some rare cases, we will get very good results starting from bad thinking. Our mistakes are not related to their consequences, as pure luck can can change the outcome and consequently hide them from our eyes.\n\nMy Apple investment has not been life-changing (it's still very interesting), but it made me realize the role of luck and how important it is to get our process right in the first place.\n\nI am looking forward to my next 10-bagger: I will hopefully deserve it next time.",

    "title": "Anatomy of a 10-Bagger",
    "body": "This is (apparently) a success story. But it's more about luck than investment skills. It's the story of how I accidentally ended up with a 10-bagger in my portfolio.\n\nExactly eight years ago, in December 2013, I bought some Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock (it amounted to around 10% of my portfolio at that time) at around $72 per share. Adjusted for the recent four-for-one stock split, that is equivalent to a cost of $18 per share.\n\nI never sold those shares (well, most of them), and they nicely compounded at a yearly rate of more than 30%. Even if this can sound amazing, the reality is that I did it by mistake. Calling such an outstanding investment result a mistake can sound quite odd, but that's what it is. My choices can in theory be considered impeccable, but the reasons that lead me to apply such a behavior were far away from being based on a well-thought investment process.\n\nBefore I delve into those reasons, and in order to explain what I think a sound investment framework should look like, I will refer to Terry Smith's well-known mantra:\n\n1. Buy shares in good companies\n\n2. Don't overpay\n\n3. Do nothing\n\nOnly recently did I realize that I had unconsciously applied the above-mentioned investment principles, which is why I could reach such a surprisingly good result. Let's now analyze them one by one to see how I applied them and why.\n\nBuy shares in good companies\n\nEven if Apple was already an outstanding company eight years ago, I probably didn't really understand what a good company looked like back then and especially how good Apple was. As an engineer, I was heavily influenced by the technical aspects of the business (both as a user of their products and the knowledge acquired by working in this sector for many years), but I knew almost nothing about strategy and competitive advantages, so I was sort of half-blind.\n\nAs I today know, a company with a great product is not necessarily a great company. Technical competence and quality are paramount to capture your customers' interest (and Apple surely did it), but it is only when the value of your product/service becomes 'indispensable' for the customer that competitive advantages emerge, and there are only a few companies out there enjoying such moats that can consequently produce above-average profits for a very long time.\n\nThis means that a few years before, by following the same approach, I could have picked, for example, a company like Nokia, completely ignoring the fact that they not only possessed a tiny moat, but also that the moat was being rapidly eroded by competitors.\n\nThe high margins Apple enjoys today on their top-selling devices will come down eventually, but they are already delivering on what will provide profits and high margins for many years to come: their service business (App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, etc.). Service revenues were not significant a few years ago, but today they constitute around 22% of revenues (from the last quarter's results). That is what happens when you build a powerful ecosystem like Apple did: people won't easily jump to another one, they will stick to it.\n\nGood companies, in Terry Smith's idea, are not the ones that are thriving today, but the ones that can continue to do so for many years to come.\n\nDon't overpay\n\nBack in 2013, saying that my valuation skills were poor would have been an understatement. I could barely look at the price-earnings ratio and a few other indicators to try to determine if a stock was undervalued or not. I was a \"deep value\" investor, but without really knowing what that actually meant. I could not run a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, let alone break down a business in its parts, analyze them and make future assumptions.\n\nSo I was, again, lucky to buy Apple mostly basing my \"analysis\" on the value of a few indicators. As you can see, the price-earnings ratio at the end of the 2013 fiscal year was 12 - it even looked too high to me at that time!\n\nToday, Apple's price-earnings ratio is around 32. Is the company too expensive? The right answer is always: it depends. But for sure, Apple's multiple expansion is well deserved. The investing community now understands the company's potential, its competitive advantages and how hard it will be for its competitors to erode or destroy them.\n\nThe multiple expansion is only responsible for a 2.6 times price increase. The rest is due to Apple's earnings growth, as well as high ROIC and reinvestment rates and stock repurchases. If we add dividend returns (and growth), especially in the case an investor would have reinvested the dividends, the returns would have been even more compelling.\n\nDo nothing\n\nWhen I first bought Apple stock, I could not imagine that I would still hold it after eight years. My portfolio turnaround was quite high back then, so my investment horizon was way shorter than it is today. The only reason why I managed to hold on for such a long time was the incredible rate of stock repurchases (I have been joking with my wife that one day someone will take the company private and while scooping up the last remaining shares, will have to call me asking to sell them mine).\n\nIn 2013 alone, the company bought back the equivalent of $23 billon in stock (and, on average, it kept increasing that amount over time). Was this a good reason to hold on? Well, it was not enough. The investment landscape is full of companies squandering their hard-earned capital on stock repurchases in order to push up their stock prices (they want to gain investors' confidence and signal to the market that the stock price has a \"floor\").\n\nBut, as Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) explained multiple times, \"If youre repurchasing shares above a rationally calculated intrinsic value, you are harming shareholders.\"\n\nThat was clearly not the case for Apple. But here's the issue: as I could not calculate Apple's intrinsic value (or better, a range of potential intrinsic values), I couldn't know if the company's stock repurchases were actually beneficial or not. I was just lucky to have Tim Cook and Luca Maestri invest that money for me for the last eight years; I could not hope for better capital allocators.\n\nConclusions\n\nMy Apple investment turned out to be very successful. We're not going to have more than a few 10-baggers in our investment life (in the best case). I bought a great company at a very good price and kept it in my portfolio for many years, but I did it for the wrong reasons.\n\nWe should learn from our mistakes, but we should not judge them from their outcomes. In some rare cases, we will get very good results starting from bad thinking. Our mistakes are not related to their consequences, as pure luck can can change the outcome and consequently hide them from our eyes.\n\nMy Apple investment has not been life-changing (it's still very interesting), but it made me realize the role of luck and how important it is to get our process right in the first place.\n\nI am looking forward to my next 10-bagger: I will hopefully deserve it next time.",

    "title": "Igraine Plc - Audited Results to 31 December 2020",
    "body": "IGRAINE PLC\n\nAQSE: KING\n\n(\"Igraine\" or the \"Company\")\n\nAudited Final Results to 31 December 2020\n\nSTRATEGIC REPORT\n\nPRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Company's principal activity is that of an investment company listed on the Access Segment of the AQSE Growth Market (formerly the NEX Exchange Growth Market) with trading symbol AQSE:KING\n\nSince June 2017, the Company's investment strategy has been focused on the service and technology sectors, including products related to social or life enhancement.\n\nFollowing the restructuring process concluded in September 2020 and the appointment of Brian Jones as Non-Executive Chairman, the Company has continued to support its existing investments, focused on the service and technology sectors (including products related to social or life enhancement), with a view to achieving exits where opportunities arise. The Company will narrow the focus of its investment strategy going forward, to target businesses and companies where the opportunity exists to develop complementary services that support the NHS in delivering high quality, patient focused, integrated care.\n\nIt is intended that the Company will, invest through a number of financial instruments including but not limited to; secured convertible loan notes, equity and to acquire shareholdings in UK based or overseas companies whose managements are proposing to seek a stock market quotation in the short/medium term, although the acquisition of minority interests in companies already admitted to the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange or the AQSE Growth Market will not necessarily be precluded. The Directors will also consider investment opportunities where the natural exit strategy will be through a trade sale.\n\nIn April 2021, the Company began to conduct a recapitalisation and restructure welcoming new Directors, investment and adopting a revised investment policy, focusing on the med-tech industry. Please refer to the Directors Post Year End Review for full detail.\n\nREVIEW OF BUSINESS\n\nDuring the year to 31 December 2020 the Company made a loss before amortisation of preference shares of £560,573 (31 December 2019: loss of £2,798,129). Following Meetings of both classes of Shareholders the Company's preference shares were converted into ordinary shares on 26 September 2020. This resulted in a write back to reserves of £4,548,821. During the year there was a charge of £278,980 (31 December 2019: £557,959) in respect of amortisation of the preference shares which was required up to date of conversion. In addition, there was a charge of £418,087 crystallised on the conversion of the shares.\n\nAs at 31 December 2020, the Company had net liabilities per share totalling 0.01p (2019: 0.55p)\n\nWallet Ads\n\nOn 2 January 2019 the Company announced that £150,000 of secured convertible loan notes (\"Loan Notes\") had been converted into equity representing 20% of the ordinary share capital of Wallet Ads.\n\nWallet Ads owns and operates a mobile engagement platform that combines mobile wallet passes (Apple Wallet / Google Pay), HTML5 web and social media (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp) technologies to enable brands to deliver digital vouchers or passes direct to consumers' smartphones. Wallet Ads became revenue generating in the latter half of 2019, although progress was mostly linked to test campaigns.\n\nFurther development of the platform stalled in 2020 due to the limited working capital available to Wallet Ads with it requiring further investment. The Company will not be providing further investment to Wallet Ads and The Directors continue to monitor this investment, consider it non-core and will seek to materialise value from the investment position.\n\nRapid Nutrition\n\nIn early January 2020 the Company received the final repayment of the loan monies previously advanced to Rapid Nutrition Plc (\"Rapid\"), a natural healthcare company focused on the research, development and production of a range of life science products. Rapid is presently listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange, Zurich, and has also applied for the dual admission of its existing issued shares to the OTCQB listing segment of the OTC Market.\n\nAs part of negotiations in recovering the loan in full the Company agreed to forgo any remaining costs and interest due on the loan in exchange for 232,010 fully paid shares, in addition to 250,000 fully paid ordinary shares previously accepted in lieu of interest due on the loan.\n\nThe Company's shareholding in Rapid represents a 0.8% holding. Rapid's share price was USD 0.138 at 31 December 2020 with the movement in the share price leading to a fair value loss of £3,132 in the year.\n\nXMG\n\nWe reported in 2017 that we had provided a loan facility, to X Markets Group Limited (\"XMG\"). XMG seeks to provide non-bank liquidity offering executable prices for a variety of mainly spot products which includes CFDs, FX, futures and equities. It streams prices to its clients who are forex and CFD brokers as well as tier-1 & tier-2 banks, brokers and other financial institutions (and exchanges) for their own clients' order execution.\n\nThe Company continues to work with the director of XMG, who previously reported ongoing delays in securing funding needed to commence trading. This has continued to be the case in 2020.\n\nThe balance of the loan to XMG at 31 December 2020 was £178,776 of which £100,000 is secured by way of a personal guarantee provided by the director of XMG. Having reviewed this investment and in light of the developments during 2020 The Directors consider the full provision made against this loan in 2019 to continue to be appropriate although the Company will continue to seek to recover this balance.\n\nOne Media\n\nIn 2013 the Company invested in One Media (OME). Following numerous attempts to support the officers of OME in their efforts to stabilise the business, ultimately OME was unable to secure additional funding to re-energise that business. In late 2019 the SEC suspended trading in OME and since that time the Directors have sought to refinance the business. In December 2020 they advised that their efforts had proved fruitless, partially affected by the difficulties caused by the COVID-19 crisis, and they had collectively stepped down. OME is now in the hands of the SEC who are likely to dissolve it in due course. Any monies due from this investment were fully written off as at 31 December 2020.\n\nJust Bee Drinks\n\nOn the 10 April 2019 the Directors of Igraine PLC announced that the Company had agreed to subscribe £150,000 for 1,840,000 Ordinary A shares in Just Bee Drinks Limited (\"Just Bee\"). This investment, which formed part of a total equity fund raise of £292,000, represented an equity stake of 9.14% in Just Bee following completion of this funding round. In addition, Igraine PLC agreed to provide a working capital loan to Just Bee supported by a first ranking fixed and floating debenture over the assets of Just Bee Drinks Ltd. To date this facility has not been called upon.\n\nAt the time of the investment, Just Bee produced a 100% natural juicy water drink, sweetened with a drop of honey. The brand was developed by beekeepers and also has a social and ethical mission to protect bees, helping to plant bee-friendly wildflower patches across the UK, with 5 million flowers planted to date.\n\nDuring 2020, the Covid-19 crisis saw a significant impact on sales as key customers streamlined their product lines. After significant Board discussions it was decided that the company was to close down its drinks production and that they were to be replaced by a new range of vitamin honey products. Since this change in strategic direction, early sales show indications of promise but the change in operational direction from point of original investment has altered the company's ability to materialise value from this investment and the company are not considering future investment by way of equity or debt. The Board have reviewed this investment and in light of these developments in conjunction with the latest accounts and are of the view that this investment should be written down to £15,113 at 31 December 2020.\n\nASSIF\n\nThe Directors of Igraine announced in May 2019 that the Company agreed to subscribe for up to £150,000 0% fixed rate secured convertible loan notes (\"Notes\") issued by ASSIF Limited (\"ASSIF\"), a company that is developing a digital product related to employees' mental health. The loan was to be provided in two equal sums, the second due when certain conditions were met and are supported by a first ranking legal charge over the assets of ASSIF.\n\nThe conversion will be for a maximum of 35% of the ordinary equity share capital of ASSIF, which will be reduced by 5% of the ordinary equity share capital in respect of a number of key milestones achieved prior to conversion to a minimum of 15%.\n\nASSIF is a mental health and wellness platform. It will primarily be a community for peer to peer support for people worried about mental health. Within the platform will be tools to help individuals with their mental health, including gamification and breathing videos. ASSIF is using cutting edge technology to deliver said tools and will have a consumer application and a business to business platform.\n\nCOVID - 19 has caused a number of inevitable delays to the early development of the platform although discussions with key major institutions, targeted as early adopters of the platform, continue to be constructive. In addition, the delay in executing the previous plan for the platform and continuing discussions with potential early adopters have seen the platform change significantly from what was originally planned. During the year ASSIF identified the need for substantial further pre revenue investment and stated their intention to repay the loan plus interest and costs. Discussions are continuing at this time.\n\nThe Board have therefore reviewed this financial asset and have estimated that its fair value at 31 December 2020 was equal to cost. The primary justification for this is the fact that nothing has been noted to suggest that the fair value has fallen to below cost since the convertible loan notes were purchased and the business has continued to progress with its aims for the year.\n\nCAPITAL REORGANISATION\n\nOn 18 June 2020, the Company entered into a framework agreement with Brian Jones under which he provided £30,000 of funding in the form of convertible loan notes and, subject to the conversion of the preference shares then in issue to ordinary shares, was to provide a further £20,000 of funding which would result in him holding 29.90% of the ordinary shares capital of the Company following the conversion of both the loan notes and the preference shares. This was completed on 29 September 2020.\n\nPOST-YEAR END REVIEW\n\nDue to a late filing of the Company's final results for the Year Ending, 30 December 2019, the Company's shares were suspended in 2020.\n\nOn 26 April 2021, the Company completed a recapitalisation and Board change, introducing new Directors, Mr Simon Grant-Rennick and Mr Burns Singh Tennent-Bhohi. After the Company's Annual General Meeting held on 26 April 2021, Mr Brian Jones & Mr Kenneth Hillen resigned from the Board of Directors.\n\nThe injection of new capital and Directors enabled the Company to review its existing financial position, its underlying assets and consider how best to progress and create value for shareholders of the Company. I am pleased to report that on 11 June 2021, the Company announced and posted a Circular to convene a General Meeting to approve proposals and resolutions to create a premier MedTech and biotech investment company that includes a conditional brokered financing for gross proceeds of, £2,000,500.\n\nAs at date of this report the Company confirms that the resolutions and proposals put to the shareholders of the Company were duly passed.\n\nOn 28 July 2021 the Company changed its name to Igraine PLC.\n\nThe Financing\n\n£2,000,500 (gross proceeds) through the issue of, 77,519,230 new ordinary shares at a subscription price of, £0.025807 which is considered to have put the Company in a robust financial position.\n\nChange of Corporate Advisor\n\nThe company appointed Peterhouse Capital Limited as the company's Corporate Advisor & Corporate Broker\n\nBOARD ADDITIONS\n\nSir Professor Christopher Evans (aged 63) - Executive Chairman\n\nProfessor Sir Christopher Evans is the founder and Chairman of Excalibur Group and a renowned scientist and highly successful entrepreneur with numerous prestigious awards and medals for his work over the last 30 years during which time he has built more than 50 medical companies from start-up and floated 20 new medical businesses on stock markets in six different countries.

The proposed Co-Investment Agreement will give the Company privileged access to attractive opportunities which have been sourced, selected and subjected to due diligence by sector experts.\n\nIts objective will be to develop and commercialise these opportunities to provide attractive returns to its investors. The Company will do this through the sourcing and identification of promising technologies, the arrangement of appropriate financing for those technologies and experienced management oversight of the structured development of the technologies and, ultimately, their commercialisation.\n\nThe Company will execute its strategy by sourcing world class innovation from a rich pipeline of opportunities. The pipeline of opportunities will be derived from four key sources:\n\n? personal and professional networks - the newly appointed Directors and senior leadership team bring high quality and extensive networks of personal, professional and industry contacts (including an extensive network of scientists and key opinion leaders in medicine both inside and outside pharmaceutical corporates). In particular, such extensive networks provide opportunities to pursue relationships with pharmaceutical companies which are both a potential source of innovative opportunities and as potential acquirers;\n\n? academia - contacts developed over many years with leading universities and other academic and research institutions globally provide direct access to innovative technologies, ahead of third parties;\n\n? the professional adviser market - links with Peterhouse Capital and others ensure we will see opportunities before the broader investor market will; and\n\n? fund managers - the newly appointed Directors maintain close relationships with fund managers who can provide a source of innovative opportunities.\n\nThe new Executive Team will make such opportunities subject to a rigorous evaluation process. Initially there will be a high level assessment where the following criteria are considered:\n\ndoes the technology have a potential market; are there any competing technologies known to be under development; at what stage of development is the technology; basic assessment of intellectual property rights; and vetting of the team or the business owning and managing the technology.\n\nMore detailed assessment will follow, typically after having entered a confidentiality agreement to review more substantial information in relation to proprietary technology. This would involve a direct consultation with the inventor(s), and technical and scientific validation by the Company's proposed consultants.to ascertain the following:\n\nwhether the technology has breakthrough quality; if the scientific base of the proposal is sound; ownership of intellectual property rights in relation to the technology (including patentability, \"freedom to operate\" and identifying if any third party intellectual property rights are necessary for the further development and ultimate commercialisation of the innovation); assessment of the suitability of the development of the technology from a regulatory perspective (in particular whether there are any potential reasons for refusing the licensing of a product candidate); and to identify the requirements and approximate timing of achieving commercialisation.\n\nIf these pass muster then a final stage of due diligence would be undertaken to ascertain the available options to acquire an interest in the opportunity. Should an opportunity be available then a final stage is completed as follows:\n\nlegal due diligence as to intellectual property rights, including ownership, restrictions to operations and licence arrangement, corporate governance and existing financing arrangements; clinical due diligence as to robustness and fitness for purpose of the clinical trials and the suitability of the CRO; any ethical and regulatory issues, requirements for permits and consents; - feasibility of key milestone achievement (such as a product candidate approval by relevant regulatory agencies) within pre-defined time frames and appropriateness of the proposed endpoints; and targeted disease indication; commercialisation potential as to availability or achievability of CMC for Investigational New Drug applications (INDs) and New Drug Applications (NDAs); projected cost and location of product manufacturing; access to market and size of potential market; product pricing and projected time and rate of return on development costs; availability of one or more highly innovative product candidates, products or proprietary technologies targeting a significant medical and/or commercial need; and - presence of foreseeable sustainable competitive advantages; financing arrangements as to adequacy of existing finance; assessment of financial strength of investors; and availability of funding quality of the scientific and management credentials of the team examination and possible adaptation of appropriate development plan and business plan.\n\nIgraine completed Co-Investment Rights with Excalibur Healthcare\n\nOn 28 June 2021, following the resolutions being passed at the company's AGM, Excalibur Healthcare Services granted the Company rights to co-invest in all healthcare and life-science investment opportunities sourced or invested into by Excalibur Healthcare Services. As consideration for the granting to the Company of these co-investment rights, and the purchase of the 2% stake in Excalibur Medicines Ltd (\"EML\"), the Company has agreed to pay the vendors the following consideration;\n\n£600,000 in cash, plus £500,000 of new Deferred Shares in the Company at an issue price of 5p per share (approximately 2x the placing price). These Deferred Shares will not be admitted to trading on Aquis, will be non-transferable, and will have no rights attached. They will be cancelled on the 6-month anniversary of issue unless, within 30 calendar days of the publication of the results of the trial of the AZD1656 drug, the Board of Igraine PLC, at its sole discretion, unanimously agree that the trial has been a success and thus consent to the immediate conversion of all Deferred Shares into the equivalent number of new ordinary shares in the Company.\n\nABOUT EML INVESTMENT\n\nEML has secured exclusive rights to and owns the patents on a drug, AZD1656, which is being developed as a potential therapeutic for diabetics suffering from COVID-19. As there are very few new therapeutics in development for COVID-19 and associated virally transmitted diseases (most research is in combining existing treatments) this has the potential to be highly attractive to big pharma and biotech buyers. Further, if the trials are successful, it is likely the drug will be effective for the general population in Covid -19 and in other respiratory diseases. The results of the Phase 2 trials of the drug - the ARCADIA trial - to assess the safety and efficacy of AZD1656 in 150 patients with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who have been hospitalised with COVID-19, were released on the 9 September 2021:\n\nResults from ARCADIA Phase II Clinical Trial of a Potential Therapy for COVID-19\n\nSt George Street Capital, a UK-based biomedical charity, and Excalibur Medicines Ltd., a biotechnology investment company, are pleased to announce the receipt of the final data from the ARCADIA Phase ll clinical trial which was conducted to assess a therapy that could treat diabetic patients suffering from COVID-19.\n\nIn light of the encouraging trial results, St George Street Capital and Excalibur will immediately start to undertake commercial discussions with potential licensees and/or fundraise for further clinical trials to investigate AZD1656 in a larger study. Further analysis to determine the precise nature of the biological effects of AZD1656 that explain the observed clinical outcomes will also be conducted.\n\nThe trial data has shown the following:\n\nEfficacy:\n\nA strong trend towards reduced mortality in patients receiving AZD1656. This was noted in both mortality on treatment and all-cause mortality, which were lower in the AZD1656 group compared to the placebo group. The strong trend to improved mortality for patients on AZD1656 was observed on top of patients receiving other medication, including dexamethasone, as part of standard of care. Certain clinically and biochemically defined subsets of patients appeared to benefit most from treatment with AZD1656. The data from ARCADIA supports continued investigation of AZD1656 for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, with or without diabetes, in future clinical trials.\n\nSafety and Tolerability:\n\nAZD1656 was shown to be well-tolerated in this patient population with no serious adverse reactions (SARs) occurring. The degree of glycaemic control, as measured by the need to increase baseline medication requirements or the need to add additional diabetic medications, was no different between the AZD1656 group and the placebo group. The proportion of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) was numerically lower in the AZD1656 group compared with the placebo group. The proportion of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) was also no different between the groups. Overall no safety concerns were identified regarding the use of AZD1656 in this patient population.\n\nDiabetes, whether type 1 or 2, has been the leading single cause of co-morbidity during the pandemic and one in three of all deaths with COVID-19 in hospital in England have been associated with diabetes.\n\nAbout the ARCADIA Trial\n\nAZD1656 was identified by St George Street Capital as a potential treatment for people with diabetes infected with COVID-19.\n\nThe objectives of the ARCADIA clinical trial were to assess the safety and tolerability of a glucose kinase activator, AZD1656, and to determine the effect of the therapy on clinical improvement and mortality in people with diabetes hospitalised with COVID-19. The trial also explored whether AZD1656 benefits COVID-19 patients via its effects on immune function.\n\nARCADIA was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II clinical trial involving 153 patients. The clinical trial was arranged and structured by Professor Sir Chris Evans, Chairman and CEO of Excalibur Healthcare Services, through its subsidiary, Excalibur Medicines Ltd. Sir Chris worked closely with Professor John Martin and his team at St George Street, a UK-based biomedical research charity, which secured the initial project and permission to run the trial from AstraZeneca.\n\nAs at date of this report, the Company has a well capitalised treasury, newly constructed investment policy and has welcomed Directors that have been at the forefront of innovation and value creation in the MedTech, life sciences and biotech industries.\n\nDividends\n\nThe Directors do not propose a dividend in respect of the year ended 31 December 2020 (2019: nil).

    "title": "Bulls In A Bear Market: These 10 Stocks Clocked Gains In Excess Of 100% In 2022 - Helmerich & Payne (NYSE:HP)",
    "body": "The tech sector underperformed, while energy and consumer staple stocks weathered the adversities relatively better.\n\n2022 would go down as one of the worst years for the financial markets. The sell-off has been all-pervasive, with stocks, bonds and cryptos all selling off indiscriminately. Even as high-fliers like Apple Inc. AAPL and Tesla Inc. TSLA bit the dust, there were a few that stood towering tall, defying the macro and geopolitical challenges.\n\nSee Also: Best Depression Stocks\n\nHere's Benzinga's list of best-performing stocks screened based on a few criteria:\n\nTarget Hospitality, founded in 1978, provides cost-effective and customized specialty rental accommodations, culinary services and hospitality solutions for end markets, including oil, gas, energy infrastructure and the government. The Woodland, Texas-based company's third-quarter results revealed 79% revenue growth and 125% adjusted EBITDA growth. The stock got a solid lift in July following the release of its second-quarter results, in which it upwardly revised its revenue guidance.\n\nAfter a consolidation move, the stock legged up again, reacting to the third-quarter results.\n\nThe average analysts' price target, compiled by TipRanks, is $20.67, suggesting roughly 42% upside potential on top of the stellar run for the year.\n\nHouston, Texas-based Amplify Energy is an independent oil and natural gas company. The stock's rally that began at the start of 2022 continued unhindered through the middle of the year, coinciding with oil's rally. Subsequently, the stock was locked in a broad sideways move, as oil's rally lost steam.\n\nGiven crude oil prices could stay high amid supply constraints and forecasts for higher demand, the stock could be in for further upside from current levels.\n\nPrometheus is a clinical-stage biotech based out of San Diego, California, and it focuses on developing therapeutics and companion diagnostic products for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. The company went public in early 2021 and its shares were listed on the Nasdaq in March 2021.\n\nThe bulk of the gains made this year came in early December, as the stock skyrocketed over 166% in reaction to positive Phase 2 data for its antibody treatment PRA023 in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.\n\nThe stock presents a roughly 31% upside, going by the average analysts' price target of $142.22.\n\nInternational Seaways owns and operates a fleet of 77 vessels, comprising crude, product and chemical tankers. It provides shipping services to customers through voyage charters, commercial pools and time charters.\n\nThe stock has been on a broader uptrend this year, interspersed by occasional pullbacks. The reopening economies proved salubrious for transportation stocks, as demand for goods and commodities increased.\n\nThe average analysts' price target for International Seaways stock is $53, translating to a 39% upside potential.\n\nNexTier, another Houston, Texas-based company, is a land oilfield service company in the U.S., offering a diverse set of well completion and production services across basins. As has been with the case of Amplify Energy, the bulk of the gains were notched up in the first half of the year and subsequently, it has gone through a broad consolidation move.\n\nThe stock potentially offers 78% upside potential, going by the average analysts' price target of $16.83.\n\nADMA is a commercial biopharma that develops specialty plasma-derived biologics for the treatment of immunodeficient patients at risk for infection, and others who are at risk for certain infectious diseases.\n\nIt currently markets three FDA-approved plasma-derived biologics. Earlier this month, ADMA preannounced fourth-quarter revenue that came in well ahead of the consensus. The company recently raised $69 million in gross proceeds from an equity offering.\n\nThe average analysts' price target for the stock is $5, suggesting there exists an upside potential of about 38%.\n\nWoodcliff Lake, New Jersey-based Hudson Tech is a provider of sustainable refrigerant products and services to the heating ventilation air conditioning and refrigerator industry.\n\nCTI Biopharma is a commercial-stage biopharma focusing on the development and commercialization of targeted therapies for blood-related cancers. The company's Vonjo has been approved for treating adults with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis, having low platelet count. Myelofibrosis is a rare bone marrow disorder that disrupts blood cell production.\n\nIn the third quarter, the product fetched a revenue of $18.2 million, up 48% from the previous quarter.\n\nThe FDA approval received in early March sparked off a rally in the stock that lasted through August. Since then, the stock has given back some of its gains.\n\nThe stock offers 88% upside potential based on the average analysts' price target of $10.34.\n\nWaltham, Massachusetts-based Ardelyx focuses on therapies to meet significant unmet medical needs. The company turned into a commercial-stage biopharma following FDA approval for its Ibsrela, which is indicated for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation in adults. The company began commercializing the product in April. In the third quarter, Ibsrela fetched a revenue of $4.9 million.\n\nThe stock has begun to pick up momentum in the second half of the year. In mid-November, it received a shot in the arm from a positive Adcom verdict for its Xphozah, which is being studied for the control of serum phosphorus in adult patients with chronic kidney disease on dialysis.\n\nThe average analysts' price target for the stock is $6.53, suggesting a nearly 175% upside potential.\n\nTulsa, Oklahoma-based Helmerich & Payne is an oilfield services company manufacturing and operating high-performance drilling rigs in conventional and unconventional plays around the world.\n\nThe stock offers 20% upside potential, based on the average analysts' price target of $58.90.\n\nUnderlying Theme: The biggest winners of 2022 mostly belonged to the oil and related sectors and the biopharma industry. The outlook for those companies that are sensitive to oil prices is clouded. Recession fears have driven down oil price forecast for 2023, with Goldman Sachs' latest estimate at $92 a barrel, down from its previous forecast of $105 a barrel. This still leaves scope for upside from the $80-a-barrel at which WTI-grade is currently trading.\n\nThere are other variables going into the equation such as China reopening, Western sanctions impacting Russian energy supplies etc.\n\nThe prospects of the biopharma stocks hinge on binary events, with economic setbacks having very little impact.",

    "title": "Apple Stock: Get Ready for a Strong 2024, Says Dan Ives",
    "body": "Well, there it is. It's almost time to officially bid farewell to 2023 and to a stunning stock market performance. The S&P 500 is seeing out the year up by 24% but even that is small change compared to the tech-heavy NASDAQ's 43% return.\n\nThere's no doubt it has been the year of the tech giant, with the stocks dubbed the Magnificent 7 driving the bullish narrative. So, can we expect more of the same in 2024 or will it more closely resemble 2022's bear market? While that remains to be seen, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives thinks another vintage year for tech is about to play out. \"In our opinion the new tech bull market has now begun and tech stocks are set up for a strong 2024 with tech stocks we expect to be up 25% over the next year,\" the 5-star analyst said.\n\nAnd right at the top of that pyramid sits the biggest Big Tech of them all. Following 2023 gains of 48%, Ives expects another show of strength for Apple (AAPL) in 2024. \"Apple remains our Top Tech Pick with a strong iPhone 15 upgrade cycle playing out with a strong and no drama (vs. last December supply chain agita) holiday season which appears humming into 2024 despite the growing noise and Huawei competition in China,\" he explained.\n\nDespite what Ives terms the \"iPhone China demise narrative,\" based on his Asia supply chain checks, that is nothing more than a \"great fictional story\" cooked up by the bears and does not reflect \"underlying mainland China growth\" which has remained strong in the December quarter.\n\niPhone aside, Ives thinks the increasingly important Services segment has now returned to \"steady double-digit growth,\" believing that on a standalone basis, the business is worth between $1.5 trillion to $1.6 trillion. \"In a nutshell,\" Ives summed up, \"2024 is the year for Cook & Co. to show iPhone growth again and further monetize its golden installed base that Cupertino has built.\"\n\nTo this end, Ives maintained an Outperform (i.e., Buy) rating and Street-high $250 price target, suggesting the shares will post growth of another 30% over the next year. (To watch Ives' track record, click here)\n\nElsewhere on the Street, the stock receives an additional 22 Buys and 8 Holds, all for a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Most appear to think the upside is now capped; going by the $203.07 average target, a year from now, the shares will deliver modest returns of 5.5%.

    "title": "10 Saddest TV Show Cancellations of 2024",
    "body": "2024 was another big year for television as new series like Shõgun, Nobody Wants This, Fallout, and The Penguin became major talking points. While those shows earned a lot of acclaim, awards recognition, and viewership, other shows that debuted in 2024 didn't get the same appreciation. Because only a loyal few were aware of their existence, they ended up getting axed after their debut season.\n\nAdditionally, other TV cancellations in 2024 were associated with shows that either premiered the previous year or ran for two or more seasons. Seeing the headlines that these series now have a short lifespan was heartbreaking for the small but mighty fanbases. From new series like Kaos and The Brothers Sun to multi-season gems like Chucky and Our Flag Means Death, these canceled shows in 2024 deserve more seasons and a better ending.\n\n10 American Born Chinese Had Creative Action And Brilliant Representation\n\nCanceled After One Season\n\nIMDB Rating: 7 Watch on Disney+\n\nDisney+ is home to many shows revolving around the Marvel and Star Wars IP, yet there are a few hidden gems that go under the radar. American Born Chinese was a creative venture based on Gene Luen Yang's graphic novel. The series follows teenager Jin Wang whose ordinary high school life gets turned upside down when he meets foreign-exchange student Wei-Chen. After this meetup, Jin learns about Wei-Chen's involvement in a battle between Chinese mythological gods.\n\nAmerican Born Chinese combines elements of a nostalgic high school sitcom with the inclusion of fantastical gods and magnificent martial arts action sequences. Another main selling point was that Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan, and Stephanie Hsu, who were fresh off their career-defining turn in Everything Everywhere All at Once, were in the cast. The series debuted in May 2023 but, in January 2024, American Born Chinese got canceled because it was lost in the crowd of other popular Disney+ shows.\n\nYour changes have been saved\n\nEmail is sent\n\nEmail has already been sent\n\nAmerican Born Chinese\n\nAction\n\nComedy\n\nJin Wang is an average teenager balancing high school and home life.

Therefore, in 2024, the spin-off show Dead Boy Detectives brought fans back to keep them invested until The Sandman's upcoming second season. The spin-off centers on Charles and Edwin, two teenage ghosts who team up to solve supernatural mysteries.\n\nRelated\n\nEvery Dead Boy Detectives Season 1 Episode, Ranked\n\nNetflix's Dead Boy Detectives explores different tones and themes throughout Season 1 as Edwin Paine and Charles Rowland investigate new ghost cases.\n\nPosts\n\nWhile solving a new case in every episode, the ghostly detective duo also have to contend with a powerful witch who is after them. Unlike The Sandman, an expansive fantasy series, Dead Boy Detectives chose a different formula by combining procedural cases with dashes of comedy, drama, and the supernatural. The approach worked, according to fans and critics, who praised the show for its creative premise, character development, and inclusion of LGBTQ+ themes. Unfortunately, Dead Boy Detectives couldn't muster the same traction as The Sandman. So, it got the axe a few months after the first season arrived.\n\nYour changes have been saved\n\nEmail is sent\n\nEmail has already been sent\n\nDead Boy Detectives\n\nTV-MA\n\nComedy\n\nMystery\n\nAdventure\n\nIn a unique blend of supernatural and mystery, two ghostly adolescents refuse to pass into the afterlife, choosing instead to remain on Earth to solve crimes involving the supernatural.

Her most underappreciated project in recent memory is Netflix's The Brothers Sun, which premiered at the beginning of 2024. The show follows the Sun family, primarily made up of Charles, Bruce, and Mama. When eldest son Charles learns about the assassination of a Taiwanese triad leader, he goes to Los Angeles to protect Bruce and Mama.\n\nBruce learns some harsh and shocking truths about Charles' line of work as a hitman and must grow accustomed to the gangster life. While Michelle Yeoh is the famous star that drew viewers in, they were equally hooked by the performances of Justin Chien and Sam Li. The Brothers Sun has a strong balance between a family dramedy about estranged siblings and an enthralling crime story with terrific action and an authentic representation of Chinese-American culture. Even with these elements and the fact it landed in Netflix's Top 10 when it debuted, The Brothers Sun got canceled due to less-than-stellar viewership, leaving some burning questions unresolved.\n\nYour changes have been saved\n\nEmail is sent\n\nEmail has already been sent\n\n8\n\n10\n\nThe Brothers Sun\n\nTV-MA\n\nAction\n\nComedy\n\nDrama\n\nFollows Charles Sun, a Taipei gangster who's settled into his life as a ruthless killer, but must go to L.A. to protect his mother and younger brother after his father was shot by a mysterious assassin.\n\nRelease Date January 4, 2024\n\nFinale Year November 30, 2023\n\nCreator(s) Brad Falchuk\n\nCast Michelle Yeoh , Justin Chien , Sam Song Li , Highdee Kuan , Joon Lee , Alice Hewkin , Madison Hu , Rodney To\n\nMain Genre Action\n\nSeasons 1\n\nCreator\n\nWriters Byron Wu , Brad Falchuk\n\nStreaming Service(s) Netflix\n\nDirectors Kevin Tancharoen , Viet Nguyen\n\nWhere To Watch Netflix\n\nExpand\n\n7 Kaos Was an Ingenious Take on Greek Mythology\n\nCanceled After One Season\n\nClose\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.4 Watch on Netflix\n\nFantasy TV shows about gods and mythology have the potential to be expanded upon across multiple seasons, yet Netflix's Kaos couldn't get that chance. The show has one of the most original and fascinating takes on Greek mythology seen on either film or TV. The always-entertaining Jeff Goldblum stars as the paranoid and power-hungry Zeus, who is afraid of a prophecy that will likely overthrow his reign.\n\nAs Zeus tries to keep calm, three human characters learn of their destiny of taking down the corrupt and arrogant gods of Olympus. Kaos has lots of creativity as it imagines an alternate world where gods are celebrated, and fantasy beings walk amongst mortals. Plenty of care went into the production design to bring the fictional cities to life. Greek mythology admirers were also enthralled by the inclusion of other gods like Poseidon, Dionysus, and Prometheus. Along with Jeff Goldblum, Kaos has a talented cast of both American and British performers. Despite the star power and originality, Kaos didn't have a proper chance to find its audience and got canceled quickly after the first season dropped.\n\nYour changes have been saved\n\nEmail is sent\n\nEmail has already been sent\n\n3\n\n10\n\nKaos\n\nComedy\n\nDrama\n\nFantasy\n\nIn a bold reimagining of Greek mythology, the series intertwines the lives of ancient gods and mortals, illustrating their complex relationships and the timeless struggles they endure.

Was Delightfully Whimsical\n\nCanceled After Two Seasons\n\nClose\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.4 Watch on Apple TV+\n\n2024 was a stacked year for movie musicals, yet it's been hard to find a great musical show on television nowadays. For a while, Apple TV+'s Schmigadoon! kept musical fans occupied on TV before its cancellation. The show debuted back in 2021 and stars Cecily Strong and Keegan-Michael Key as couple Melissa and Josh. While on a hiking trip, the two stumble upon a magical town that has the reminiscence of an old-school musical.\n\nRelated\n\nThe Best Shows Streaming On Apple TV+\n\nFrom science-fiction series such as For All Mankind to quirky workplace comedies like Ted Lasso, Apple TV+ has a great TV show for every fan.\n\nPosts 2\n\nSince Melissa and Josh are experiencing relationship problems, they venture to find new love and become fascinated by the townspeople's spirit. Although each of Schmigadoon!'s two seasons are only six episodes long, every episode is packed with whimsy and exquisite musical numbers. Any musical fan will adore the show's homages to Sweeney Todd, Chicago, Jesus Christ Superstar, and other classics. In addition to Strong and Key showing off their theatrical sides, the supporting cast has familiar thespians, like Kristin Chenoweth, Aaron Tveit, Ariana Debose, and Patrick Page.

After The Big Bang Theory wrapped, Cuoco found new opportunities to express her range and The Flight Attendant was the perfect show to do so. The actress stars as Cassie Bowden, a flight attendant who indulges in drinking alcohol to pass the time. During a one-night stand with a passenger in Bangkok, Cassie wakes up next to his dead body.\n\nAs the FBI questions her about the death, Cassie aims to find out who the killer is. The Flight Attendant's first season was worth investing in, thanks to its twists and cliffhangers. Cuoco's lead performance elevates the story and makes Cassie a flawed protagonist who has the chance to overcome her current issues. Season 2 went further by having Cassie work part-time with the CIA while working to become sober and getting involved in the world of doppelgängers. With all these moving plotlines, The Flight Attendant never felt too ridiculous and was consistently thrilling. Unlike other canceled shows in 2024, The Flight Attendant was axed because Cuoco believed the series had run its course.\n\nYour changes have been saved\n\nEmail is sent\n\nEmail has already been sent\n\nThe Flight Attendant\n\nComedy\n\nMystery\n\nDrama\n\nA reckless flight attendant with an alcoholism problem wakes up in the wrong hotel, in the wrong bed, with a dead man - and no idea what happened.

He has appeared in multiple installments of the Child's Play franchise. Naturally, his iconicness was translated well into a TV series on Syfy. Chucky continues the franchise's bloody roots and places the killer doll in Hackensack, New Jersey. Teenager Jake Wheeler purchases a Good Guy doll, unaware that the toy is, in fact, Chucky.\n\nWhat transpires next is a series of bizarre events where Chucky goes on a rampage across the town, and Jake and his friends get caught in the crossfire. Along with having the same absurd violence and humor the franchise has been known for, the show also takes time to tackle coming-of-age themes and explore Chucky's past before his soul possessed the notorious doll. With each passing season, Chucky gets more over-the-top yet never tedious. This is especially evident in the third season, where the titular doll goes to Washington, D.C. Even though this latest entry in Chucky's story was unceremoniously canceled, fans still hold out hope that they will see him again in the future.\n\nYour changes have been saved\n\nEmail is sent\n\nEmail has already been sent\n\nChucky\n\nTV-MA\n\nComedy\n\nDrama\n\nHorror\n\nWhere to Watch\n\nSeason All Season 1 Season 2 Season 3\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\n*Availability in US\n\nRelease Date October 12, 2021\n\nFinale Year November 30, 2023\n\nCast Zackary Arthur , Brad Dourif , Björgvin Arnarson , Alyvia Alyn Lind , Jennifer Tilly , Devon Sawa , Lara Jean Chorostecki , Fiona Dourif , Michael Therriault , Carina Battrick , Alex Vincent , Teo Briones , Barbara Alyn Woods , Jackson Kelly , K.C.

The best ones are the most thought-provoking, like the MAX original series Scavengers Reign. The show centers on the surviving crew of the cargo ship Demeter 227. The ship crash-lands on a planet called Vesta, where the alien life appears beautiful, but they also carry plenty of danger.\n\nRelated\n\n10 Best Sci-Fi TV Shows That Needed Another Season\n\nFan-favorite sci-fi TV shows rarely last as long as Star Trek. But many have been taken away far too soon and deserve a comeback.\n\nPosts\n\nIn each episode, the separated survivors overcome many obstacles to return to their ship. Along with excellent sci-fi themes and storytelling, Scavengers Reign boasts mesmerizing 2-D animation to express its surreal and existential imagery. The alien world and ecosystem are spectacularly detailed, complete with creatures that appear wondrous and others that bring lots of horror. Because of the outstanding animation style and awe-inspiring worldbuilding, the show felt ingeniously original to the sci-fi genre. Understandably, viewers who were hooked by Scavengers Reign and wanted to see more of its beautiful visuals were disappointed to hear the show was canceled after 12 episodes.\n\n2 Evil Was an Underrated Horror Show That Should Have Gone Out on Its Own Terms\n\nCanceled After Four Seasons\n\nClose\n\nIMDB Rating: 7.8 Watch on Netflix and Paramount+\n\nDespite lasting four seasons and receiving loads of critical praise, Evil has always been an underappreciated horror show. Originally debuting on CBS, the series shifted gears and went to Paramount+, where they went crazier with its unsettling scares and wacky storylines. Evil centers on the trio of psychologist Kristen, priest David, and contractor Ben as they investigate unimaginable miracles, demonic possessions, and other extraordinary mysteries in each episode.\n\nEvil's emphasis on the characters figuring out these occurrences helped the show find a dedicated audience. Questions surrounding belief and morality come into play in every episode, making the series as thought-provoking as it is terrifying. From a silent episode in a church to a haunted elevator to humorous demons, Evil always had something creative up its sleeve. People were in love with this delightfully weird and horrifying series, so it came as a surprise when the show's plug was pulled after four seasons, resulting in a sudden closure. While the decision disappointed fans, Evil should still be commended for its unique approach to TV horror.\n\nYour changes have been saved\n\nEmail is sent\n\nEmail has already been sent\n\nEvil\n\nHorror\n\nDrama\n\nCrime\n\n\"Evil,\" a 2019 TV series created by Robert and Michelle King, masterfully blends elements of psychological thriller and supernatural drama.

Set during the early 18th century, the comedy adventure series follows Stede Bonnet, played by Rhys Darby, as he leaves his privileged life of being a gentleman behind to become a pirate. Stede and his new crew plan to make history while sailing on the ship, \"Revenge.\" Additionally, Stede crosses paths with and develops feelings for the famed pirate Blackbeard.\n\nOur Flag Means Death was a landmark show for LGBTQ+ representation, which explains why it has garnered a cult following and received tons of positive word-of-mouth. The series has a rightfully adventurous tone, but it shines the best when delving into character relationships. Stede and Blackbeard's love story gets a lot of prominence and becomes splendidly eventful to watch. Not only did the fanbase enjoy the show, but critics did too, as the two seasons made multiple \"best of the year\" lists while it was airing. MAX canceled the show after those two seasons, a controversial decision viewed by many. Considering how much positive reception it got and how much authentic representation went into the story, fans of Our Flag Means Death continuously hope the show will be saved.\n\nYour changes have been saved\n\nEmail is sent\n\nEmail has already been sent\n\nOur Flag Means Death\n\nAdventure\n\nComedy\n\nRomance\n\nBiography\n\nWhere to Watch\n\nSeason All Season 1 Season 2\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nstream rent buy\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\nNot available\n\n*Availability in US\n\nRelease Date March 3, 2022\n\nFinale Year November 30, 2022\n\nCast Rhys Darby , Con O'Neill , Rory Kinnear , Matthew Maher , Samson Kayo , Ewen Bremner , David Fane , Nathan Foad , Taika Waititi , Guz Khan , Vico Ortiz , Joel Fry , Kristian Nairn\n\nRating\n\nSeasons 2\n\nStory By david jenkins, eliza jimenez cossio, zayre ferrer\n\nWriters Eliza Jiménez Cossio , Zayre Ferrer , David Jenkins\n\nStreaming Service(s) MAX\n\nDirectors Taika Waititi , Fernando Frias\n\nShowrunner David Jenkins\n\nExpand",

    "title": "3 ETPs to Play Buffett's Moat Advantage",
    "body": "Legendary investor Warren Buffett believes that the most critical factor in picking a successful investment is determining the durability of a company's competitive advantage or \"moat.\" An economic moat refers to a company's ability to maintain a competitive advantage over its competitors to protect its profits and market share.\n\nA company can create a moat through cost advantages, having a size advantage, ensuring high switching costs, and possessing unique intangibles, such as patents and brand recognition. For example, Apple Inc. (AAPL) has created an economic moat through its perceived quality and brand recognition that has allowed the company to protect market share from competitors offering lower-priced products.\n\nInvestors who want to embrace the central pillar of Buffett's investment strategy should consider these three exchange-traded products (ETPs) that provide exposure to companies that have sustainable economic moats.\n\nVanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF (MOAT)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF, formed in 2012, aims to provide returns similar to those of the Morningstar Wide Moat Focus Index. The fund does this by investing its assets in securities that comprise the underlying index.\n\nThese securities are companies that Morningstar Inc. deems to have a substantial competitive advantage gained from proprietary operations and assets, such as patents and high switching costs.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Morningstar Wide Moat ETF has assets under management (AUM) of $15.47 billion as of Dec. 24, 2024. Its net expense ratio is 0.47%. As of Nov. 30, 2024, the fund has three- and five-year average annualized returns of 11.45% and 13.93%, respectively. Year to date (YTD), MOAT has returned 16.01%.\n\nVanEck Vectors Morningstar International Moat ETF (MOTI)\n\nLaunched in 2015, the VanEck Vectors Morningstar International Moat ETF seeks to track the performance of the Morningstar Global Markets ex-US Wide Moat Focus Index. The manager achieves this by investing the majority of the fund's assets in securities that comprise the benchmark index.\n\nThese are primarily international companies that Morningstar believes to have a competitive advantage and attractive valuation.\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Morningstar International Moat ETF has net assets of $153.84 million as of Dec. 24, 2024, and a net expense ratio of 0.58%. The fund has three- and five-year average annualized returns of 3.58% and 3.49%, respectively, as of Nov. 30, 2024. Year to date (YTD), MOTI has returned 3.82%\n\nVanEck Vectors Morningstar Global Wide Moat ETF (MOTG)\n\nThe VanEck Vectors Morningstar Global Wide Moat ETF, launched in 2018, seeks to track the performance of the Morningstar Global Wide Moat Focus Index. VanEck does this by investing most of the fund's assets in securities that make up the benchmark index.\n\nThese are primarily global companies that Morningstar believes to have sustainable competitive advantages and attractive prices.\n\nThe fund has net assets of $14.73 million as of Dec. 24, 2024, and a net expense ratio of 0.52%. The fund has three- and five-year average annualized returns of 5.58% and 8.95%, respectively, as of Nov. 30, 2024. Year to date (YTD), MOTG has returned 13.74%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nOne of Warren Buffett's investment strategies is to invest in companies that have a strong competitive advantage, known as an economic moat. These \"moats\" allow companies to maintain market share and profits.\n\nInvestors can gain access to companies with economic moats by investing in exchange-traded products (ETNs) that track moat indexes. VanEck offers a variety of moat ETFs that track the different moat indexes created by Morningstar. These allow investors to gain exposure and diversification to moat companies at a low cost.",

Apple's stock price, near its 52-week high of $258.21, trades at a solid 34.4% year return. Wedbush analysts say a new growth phase beckoned for the company, a 'golden era' driven by the expansion of an iPhone upgrade cycle and advanced artificial intelligence.\n\nWedbush analysts believe Apple is set for more growth as it enters a multi-year cycle of Apple iPhone upgrades with the help of AI investments. At this point, according to the firm, the market misvalues Apple's AI initiatives Apple Intelligence in particular as enough to boost revenue significantly in the years ahead. AI features for Apple's hardware and service products, such as the iPhone 16, are expected to carry the integration onto the Apple side, with such features in the hardware sector and in the services sector.\n\nThey also predicted that Apple's AI strategy would complement the rising revenue streams that are bound to power the company into a $4 trillion market cap. Apple is worth $3.9 trillion and is held by the company in a strong financial position with a gross profit margin valued at 46.2%. Like Wedbush's, JPMorgan's positive outlook echoed that Apple relies on artificial intelligence to drive growth.\n\nIt's also other news that, in China, Apple is strategizing around creating local AI models that will populate devices.",

    "body": "Chicago, IL - December 26, 2024 - Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. TSM, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Apple Inc. AAPL, Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:\n\nTSMC Stock Poised for Best Year in 25 Years - A Top Pick for 2025\n\nOn Tuesday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd., or TSMC, saw its shares touch a record high in Taipei following gains among its key customers, such as NVIDIA Corp.. TSMC's shares have surged 99.3% this year, and the stock is set for its strongest annual performance since 1999, thanks to the thriving generative artificial intelligence (AI) market.\n\nGiven that TSMC stock is primed for success, is it a good stock to buy in the new year? Let's find out -\n\nTSMC Plans to Launch New Chip Technology in 2025\n\nTSMC is producing its cutting-edge 2-nanometer (nm) chips and is expected to introduce them in 2025. The 2nm chips will reach full-scale production in 2026, with its pre-order demand surpassing that of 3nm and 5nm chips.\n\nThe 2nm chips feature nanosheet transistor technology that enhances the efficiency level. They are designed to consume 25-30% less energy, boost battery life and curtail costs. So, along with continued demand for the present 3nm chips, the upcoming next-generation chip will boost the TSMC stock next year.\n\nTSMC Sees Multiple Growth Prospects\n\nTSMC not only produces chips for graphic processing unit companies like NVIDIA but also smartphone chips for players like Apple Inc., recently witnessed an uptick in smartphone sales, a positive signal for TSMC.\n\nTSMC also manufactures custom chips for Marvell Technology, Inc. and Broadcom Inc.. Both companies have already placed orders with TSMC to meet the growing demand for custom AI chips. TSMC's diversified partnerships, therefore, reduce the dependence on NVIDIA, offering various growth prospects that favor the stock next year.\n\nSemiconductor Market Growth Benefits TSMC Stock\n\nThe global semiconductor market is estimated to generate $2 trillion and more in revenues by 2032 at a CAGR of almost 15%, according to Precedence Research. Similarly, McKinsey expects the worldwide semiconductor market to surpass annual revenues of $1 trillion by the end of 2030.\n\nThe growing semiconductor market is a tailwind for the TSMC stock next year since it's the largest semiconductor foundry with a 62% market share. Moreover, TSMC's rivals are struggling. Several arespinning off their foundry businesses and reducing capital expenditures.\n\nTSM Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist\n\nWith the TSMC stock destined to scale upward in the new year banking on advanced chip technology, a diversified business model, and market dominance, it surely is a compelling buy. As a result, TSMC's earnings per share are projected to increase by 19.8% compared to last year, with a Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.95.\n\nBrokers also assume that the TSMC stock will rise in the near term, raising the average short-term price target to $226.14 from the last closing price of $197.21 and setting the highest target at $250, an upside of 26.8%.\n\nTSMC stock at the moment has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) (read more: 3 Reasons to Buy TSM Stock Besides 54% Q3 Net Profits Surge).\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.\n\nCompany P/E P/B P/S ROE EBITDA (in billions) Gross Profit (in billions) Revenue Growth Apple Inc 42.47 68.53 10.17 23.83% $32.5 $43.88 6.07% Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co 11.34 1.16 0.97 5.72% $1.44 $2.61 15.06% NetApp Inc 21.89 27.09 3.88 32.84% $0.44 $1.18 6.15% Western Digital Corp 67.80 1.83 1.44 4.28% $0.86 $1.55 48.91% Pure Storage Inc 166.03 14.98 7.50 4.44% $0.08 $0.54 8.81% Super Micro Computer Inc 17.09 3.68 1.38 6.68% $0.4 $0.6 37.87% Eastman Kodak Co 10.21 0.59 0.62 1.34% $0.04 $0.04 -2.97% Turtle Beach Corp 53.42 3.27 0.98 3.3% $0.01 $0.03 59.51% AstroNova Inc 26.47 1.10 0.67 0.26% $0.0 $0.01 7.65% Average 46.78 6.71 2.18 7.36% $0.41 $0.82 22.62%\n\nBy conducting a comprehensive analysis of Apple, the following trends become evident:\n\nA Price to Earnings ratio of 42.47 significantly below the industry average by 0.91x suggests undervaluation. This can make the stock appealing for those seeking growth.\n\nThe elevated Price to Book ratio of 68.53 relative to the industry average by 10.21x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value.\n\nWith a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 10.17, which is 4.67x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance.\n\nThe company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 23.83%, which is 16.47% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential.\n\nCompared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $32.5 Billion, which is 79.27x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.\n\nWith higher gross profit of $43.88 Billion, which indicates 53.51x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.\n\nThe company's revenue growth of 6.07% is significantly lower compared to the industry average of 22.62%. This indicates a potential fall in the company's sales performance.\n\nDebt To Equity Ratio\n\nThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio indicates the proportion of debt and equity used by a company to finance its assets and operations.\n\nConsidering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.\n\nWhen evaluating Apple alongside its top 4 peers in terms of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights arise:\n\nIn terms of the debt-to-equity ratio, Apple is positioned in the middle among its top 4 peers.\n\nThis suggests a relatively balanced financial structure, where the company maintains a moderate level of debt while also utilizing equity financing with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.87.\n\nKey Takeaways\n\nFor Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios indicate that the stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. However, the high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest that Apple is performing well financially but may be facing challenges in revenue expansion within the industry sector.\n\nThis article was generated by Benzinga's automated content engine and reviewed by an editor.\n\nMarket News and Data brought to you by Benzinga APIs",
