You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild

disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*:

Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this

value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Indirect influence (supply chain issues, market sentiment)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Weak connection (tangential news, minor announcements)\n• **0.0**: No material impact (irrelevant or offsetting factors)\n\n### Emotional Dimensions\n\n#### Hope vs Fear (-1 → +1)\nEmotional valence about future outcomes.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme optimism (\"Apple could dominate this space\")\n• **+0.4 to

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n####

effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

no specific underlying event\n\n## Market Regime Assessment\n\n### Article-Level Market Regime\nCurrent market regime context mentioned or implied in the article.\n\n**Types**:\n• **bull**: Rising markets with general optimism, growth expectations\n• **bear**: Declining markets with pessimism, contraction fears\n• **neutral**: Stable or mixed market conditions, balanced sentiment\n• **unknown**: Market regime signals present but unclear/conflicting\n• **null**: No market regime context determinable from article\n\n### Regime Sensitivity Factors\nFor each step in causal chains, assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current narrative)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Regime-neutral (independent of market context)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Slightly counter-regime (mild contradiction to sentiment)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Moderately counter-regime (challenges current narrative)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Strongly counter-regime (good news in bear market, bad news in bull market)\n\n#### Reframing Potential (0–1)\nHow easily can this event be reframed to fit dominant narrative.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly reframable (ambiguous interpretation, easily spun either way)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderately reframable (some spin possible with context)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Somewhat reframable (limited interpretation flexibility)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited reframing options (fairly clear implications)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Hard facts (difficult to reframe, objective data)\n• **0.0**: Impossible to reframe (unambiguous, black-and-white results)\n\n#### Narrative Disruption (0–1)\nHow much this event challenges current market narrative.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly disruptive (forces major narrative reconsideration)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significantly challenging (questions established views)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately challenging (raises some doubts about assumptions)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mildly questioning (minor narrative friction)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Slightly reinforcing (mostly supports existing narrative)\n• **0.0**: Perfectly confirming (completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n• **0.26–0.50** = Business model transformation\n• **0.51–1.00** = Company reinvention (reserved for cars, healthcare, AI breakthroughs)\n\n### Calibration Examples:\n• **iPhone 15 launch**: 0.02-0.03 (incremental refresh)\n• **Apple Watch launch**: 0.05-0.08 (new category)\n• **Services push**: 0.08-0.12 (business model shift)\n• **Vision Pro**: 0.03-0.06 (early-stage new category)\n• **Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable
