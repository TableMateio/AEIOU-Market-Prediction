(NASDAQ:AAPL) will skip the launch schedule in 2026, breaking from its tradition by not releasing its base model. The reason is simple – it’s saving the spotlight for its first-ever foldable smartphone, which will be unveiled in the fall alongside iPhone 18 Air, 18 Pro, and 18 Pro Max.


During the first half of 2026, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will only debut its budget-friendly iPhone 17e, while the basic iPhone 18 will appear in 2027. Following this, the tech powerhouse will transition into a two-stage annual cycle, whereby the primary models will be introduced in the spring, and flagships and folding versions in the fall.

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Apple Inc. AAPL is gearing up for a significant overhaul of its iPhone lineup, with plans for major redesigns over the next three years. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, in his latest “Power On" report revealed that, Apple’s revamp is set to kick off this September with the introduction of the iPhone Air and iPhone 17 series. The iPhone Air, a sleek new model, is poised to replace the iPhone 16 Plus. Despite its light blue color and the debut of Apple's first in-house modem chip, the device will have a shorter battery life and will lack a physical SIM-card slot. Alongside the Air, Apple will unveil the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max. These models will bear a resemblance to the iPhone 16, but will boast a revamped camera system and an updated industrial design. The Pro models will also come in a new orange color. Apple’s innovation doesn’t stop there. In 2026, the tech giant plans to release its first foldable iPhone, codenamed V68. This device will mirror Samsung Electronics Co.'s book-style foldables, featuring four cameras and Touch ID instead of Face ID.
