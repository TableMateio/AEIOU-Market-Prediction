News API


Here’s a rundown of the services you’ll need to make your tool work:

1. News API
•Description: Provides access to news articles from various sources, which will be the core input data for the system.
•Examples: NewsAPI, GDELT, Bing News Search API

2. Financial Data API
•Description: Supplies stock data (price, volume, sentiment) for the companies you’re tracking.
•Examples: Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, Yahoo Finance API

3. Cloud Storage and Databases
•Description: Used for storing both raw and processed data, including news articles, stock data, and analytical results.
•Examples: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, MongoDB, PostgreSQL

4. GPT API (OpenAI)
•Description: Used for summarizing articles, identifying relevant factors, and generating insights from the data.
•Examples: GPT-3.5 for basic processing, GPT-4 for detailed analysis

5. Machine Learning Frameworks
•Description: For training custom models that help with decision-making, prediction, and pattern recognition based on past stock movements.
•Examples: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn

6. Stream Processing Framework
•Description: Handles real-time data processing, including incoming news and stock data for immediate predictions.
•Examples: Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming

7. ETL Tools
•Description: Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to collect and process data from multiple sources and prepare it for analysis.
•Examples: Apache Airflow, Talend, AWS Glue

8. Data Pipeline Orchestration
•Description: Automates and manages the flow of data from ingestion to analysis.
•Examples: Apache Airflow, Prefect

9. Cloud Computing
•Description: For processing large-scale data and running machine learning models.
•Examples: AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure

10. Version Control System
•Description: Manages and tracks code versions during development.
•Examples: GitHub, GitLab

11. Monitoring and Logging
•Description: Monitors system performance, logs errors, and tracks data pipeline health.
•Examples: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

12. API Management and Integration
•Description: For managing, monitoring, and integrating the various APIs.
•Examples: Postman, RapidAPI, AWS API Gateway

13. Deployment Platform
•Description: Platform to deploy the final model for real-time use.
•Examples: AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Docker for containerized deployment

14. Authentication and Security
•Description: Manages access to your tool and ensures data security.
•Examples: OAuth, AWS IAM, Auth0

15. Web Interface or Dashboard
•Description: Optional, for creating an interface where you can view predictions and monitor the tool’s performance.
•Examples: React (Frontend), Flask/Django (Backend), Tableau for visualization

16. Task Scheduling
•Description: Schedules regular tasks like data collection, analysis, and predictions.
•Examples: Cron jobs, Celery

These services form the backbone of the system, handling everything from data collection to real-time predictions.
