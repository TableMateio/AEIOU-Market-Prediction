Core Concepts

Core Concepts and Testing Methods (Condensed)
1.Stock Movement Follows Public News
•Concept: Stock price changes happen after news becomes public.
•Test: Track news release times and stock movements; verify timing of stock price shifts.
2.Investor Decisions are Complex and Multi-Step
•Concept: Decisions are multi-step processes, where one event leads to a chain reaction.
•Test: Map historical news to stock movements; model decision chains to predict future responses.
3.New Scenarios are Combinations of Past Ones
•Concept: New news is a combination of previous scenarios.
•Test: Break down new news events into components and match them with similar past events for stock movement predictions.
4.Multi-Step Decisions Lead to Stock Movements
•Concept: Investor reasoning is multi-step, with each step impacting stock price.
•Test: Map multi-step reasoning chains from past events and simulate future scenarios.
5.Early Prediction After News Release
•Concept: Predict stock movements early after news is released, before the full market reacts.
•Test: Track the delay between news release and stock movement; model the time lag for optimal early actions.
6.Trackable Business Features Affect Stock Value
•Concept: Stock price is driven by identifiable business features (e.g., product launches, revenue).
•Test: Track changes in business features over time and correlate with stock movements; create a feature-impact model.
7.Weight of News Types via Machine Learning
•Concept: Different types of news (e.g., product vs. market trends) have varying impacts.
•Test: Train ML models to quantify impact of different news types, and compare stock-specific vs. market-wide influences.
