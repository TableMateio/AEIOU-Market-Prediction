# Documentation Update Plan - Belief Layer Integration

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
We've developed a sophisticated belief modeling system that fundamentally changes our approach from simple sentiment analysis to atomic factor decomposition. This plan outlines what needs updating in each core document.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Current vs. Updated Approach

### **BEFORE: Simple Causal Chains**
```
News â†’ Sentiment â†’ Business Impact â†’ Price Movement
```

### **AFTER: Belief Layer Modeling**
```
News â†’ Perception Formation â†’ Belief State Vector â†’ Market Psychology â†’ Price Movement
```

**Key Changes:**
- News articles are **perception artifacts**, not ground truth
- Every business factor gets **10 belief dimensions** (intensity, duration, certainty, etc.)
- **Mathematical decomposition** of qualitative concepts
- **Linked record structure** for scalable data relationships
- **Temporal belief decay** and interaction modeling

---

## ðŸ“„ Document-by-Document Update Requirements

### 1. **PRD.md** - MAJOR UPDATES NEEDED

**Current Issues:**
- Still references PostgreSQL instead of our Airtable â†’ Supabase strategy
- Missing belief factor methodology entirely
- No mention of atomic decomposition framework
- Oversimplified causal chain structure

**Required Updates:**
```diff
- Step 2: News-Belief-Price Causal Chains
+ Step 2: Atomic Belief Factor Extraction

- Store as structured causal paths:
- {
-   "event": "Product Launch",
-   "belief": "Will drive upgrade cycle", 
-   "business_impact": "Revenue up",
-   "investor_reaction": "Price up (1-day)"
- }

+ Extract atomic belief vectors:
+ {
+   "business_factor": "revenue_growth",
+   "raw_magnitude": 0.08,
+   "belief_dimensions": {
+     "intensity_belief": 0.75,
+     "duration_belief": 0.60,
+     "certainty_level": 0.80,
+     "hope_vs_fear": 0.65,
+     "doubt_factor": 0.25,
+     "attention_intensity": 0.90,
+     "social_amplification": 0.70,
+     "believability_score": 0.72
+   }
+ }
```

**New Sections Needed:**
- Belief Factor Methodology
- Mathematical Decomposition Process
- Linked Record Architecture
- Temporal Dynamics Modeling
- Investor Archetype Detection

### 2. **Hypotheses.md** - COMPLETE REWRITE NEEDED

**Current Issues:**
- Written before belief layer conception
- Missing mathematical validation hypotheses
- No atomic factor testability
- Outdated investor behavior assumptions

**New Hypotheses to Add:**
```
H1: Belief Factor Independence
- Hypothesis: Individual belief dimensions (intensity, certainty, duration) 
  can be measured independently and meaningfully combined
- Test: Factor analysis on belief vectors, correlation matrices

H2: Perception Layer Validity  
- Hypothesis: News articles represent journalist perception, not events
- Test: Compare same event across multiple sources, measure perception variance

H3: Atomic Decomposition Accuracy
- Hypothesis: Complex events can be decomposed into <10 mathematical factors
- Test: Human annotation vs automated decomposition agreement >80%

H4: Belief Temporal Decay
- Hypothesis: Belief strength follows predictable decay patterns
- Test: Track belief factor changes over time, fit decay curves

H5: Source Credibility Impact
- Hypothesis: Source credibility affects belief formation more than content
- Test: Same news from different sources, measure market reaction variance

H6: Investor Archetype Distinction
- Hypothesis: Retail vs institutional investors have measurably different belief patterns
- Test: Trading volume signatures, time-of-day reaction patterns

H7: Mathematical Predictive Power
- Hypothesis: Atomic belief vectors predict market movements better than sentiment scores
- Test: Backtesting belief-based models vs sentiment-based models
```

### 3. **Lean Development Strategy.md** - PHASE UPDATES NEEDED

**Current Issues:**
- Phase validation doesn't test belief modeling assumptions
- Missing mathematical validation criteria
- No source credibility testing
- Lacks investor archetype validation

**New Validation Tests to Add:**

**Week 1 Additions:**
```diff
+ - [ ] **BELIEF FACTOR EXTRACTION**: Can we reliably decompose news into atomic factors?
+   - Take 10 major events, manually extract belief factors
+   - Compare human vs automated extraction
+   - Test: >80% agreement on factor identification?

+ - [ ] **SOURCE PERCEPTION VARIANCE**: Do different sources create different beliefs?
+   - Find same event covered by 3+ sources
+   - Test: Measurable variance in extracted belief factors?
```

**Week 2 Additions:**
```diff
+ - [ ] **MATHEMATICAL COMPOSABILITY**: Do atomic factors combine meaningfully?
+   - Test factor combination formulas on historical events
+   - Test: Combined factors predict outcomes better than individual factors?

+ - [ ] **TEMPORAL BELIEF DECAY**: Do belief factors decay predictably?
+   - Track belief strength over 30 days post-event
+   - Test: Can we fit decay curves to belief evolution?
```

### 4. **Core Concepts.md** - FUNDAMENTAL REWRITE NEEDED

**Current Issues:**
- Extremely outdated (pre-belief layer)
- Missing mathematical foundation
- No mention of perception vs reality distinction
- Lacks atomic decomposition concepts

**New Core Concepts:**
```
1. News as Perception Artifacts
   â€¢ Concept: News articles represent journalist interpretation, not ground truth
   â€¢ Test: Measure perception variance across sources for same events

2. Atomic Belief Decomposition  
   â€¢ Concept: Complex beliefs can be broken into <10 measurable factors
   â€¢ Test: Human annotation agreement on factor extraction >80%

3. Mathematical Belief Vectors
   â€¢ Concept: Every belief state can be represented as numerical vector
   â€¢ Test: Vector operations predict market outcomes better than sentiment

4. Temporal Belief Dynamics
   â€¢ Concept: Beliefs evolve predictably over time with decay patterns
   â€¢ Test: Fit decay curves to belief evolution, predict belief half-lives

5. Source Credibility Weighting
   â€¢ Concept: Source reliability affects belief formation independent of content
   â€¢ Test: Same content from different sources generates different market reactions

6. Investor Archetype Detection
   â€¢ Concept: Different investor types have distinguishable belief patterns
   â€¢ Test: Cluster analysis on trading signatures reveals investor archetypes
```

### 5. **Plan of Action.md** - ARCHITECTURE OVERHAUL NEEDED

**Current Issues:**
- References outdated PostgreSQL approach
- Missing belief modeling phases
- No mathematical validation framework
- Lacks atomic decomposition pipeline

**New Phases to Add:**

   â€¢ Build taxonomy of business factors (cost, revenue, risk, etc.)
   â€¢ Define mathematical constraints for each factor type
   â€¢ Create belief dimension scoring methodology

2. Source Credibility Framework
   â€¢ Build credibility scoring for news sources
   â€¢ Map institutional vs retail trust patterns
   â€¢ Create source bias detection algorithms

3. Mathematical Decomposition Pipeline

   â€¢ Human-in-loop verification for factor accuracy
   â€¢ Automated belief vector generation

Phase 2.5: Belief Validation Framework

   â€¢ Apply belief modeling to 100+ historical events
   â€¢ Validate belief factors against actual market outcomes
   â€¢ Measure predictive accuracy vs sentiment baselines

2. Temporal Dynamics Validation
   â€¢ Track belief evolution over multiple time horizons
   â€¢ Fit decay curves to belief factor changes
   â€¢ Validate attention span vs persistence predictions
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Priority

### **HIGH PRIORITY (Do First)**

### **LOW PRIORITY (Do Last)**
6. Create new specialized documents
7. Update secondary documentation files

## ðŸ§ª Validation Impact

These updates will ensure our documentation reflects:
- **Mathematical rigor** in belief modeling
- **Testable hypotheses** for validation framework  
- **Scalable architecture** for belief factor extraction
- **Clear success criteria** for belief-based predictions
- **Implementation roadmap** for atomic decomposition system

Without these updates, we risk building a sophisticated system that doesn't match our documented strategy and assumptions.
