Project Description


System Overview: News-Driven Stock Movement Predictor
•Goal: Predict future stock movements by analyzing how investors have historically responded to news, distinguishing between perceived value and real business impact.
•Approach:
•Collect historical news articles + timestamps.
•Pair with historical stock movement data.
•Analyze chains of reasoning from news to investor decisions.
•Build a repository of multi-step cause-effect patterns (e.g., Feature Launch → Upgrade Cycle → Revenue Growth → Stock Rise).
•Use machine learning to quantify which factors drive real vs speculative price movements.
•Predict how new news will likely impact stock based on historical analogs.

Core Functions
•News Ingestion: Fetch news headlines + articles with timestamps from Alpha Vantage News API.
•Stock Data Collection: Ingest historical stock price data (daily + intra-day) from Alpha Vantage.
•Financial Health Verification: Cross-reference long-term company fundamentals from Morningstar to assess lasting value.
•NLP Pipeline: Use GPT-3.5/4 to extract affected business features, detect sentiment, and map logic chains in news.
•Pattern Database: Structured JSON or vector DB of past event chains, labeled with outcome classes (e.g., short-term spike, long-term growth, no effect).
•Prediction Engine: Compare new news events against repository; rank historical matches; predict likely price movement.
•Evaluation Loop: Track prediction success against actual future price and earnings data.

Tech Stack
•Backend: Python (FastAPI / Flask)
•Data APIs: Alpha Vantage (news + stock), Morningstar (fundamentals)
•Storage: PostgreSQL (structured data), Pinecone or Weaviate (semantic vector DB for case comparison)
•NLP & Analysis: OpenAI GPT-3.5/4 for summarization, factor extraction, logic-chain mapping
•ML Frameworks: Scikit-learn or XGBoost for classification/regression; possibly LightGBM
•ETL/Data Pipelines: Apache Airflow or Prefect for scheduled ingestion
•Dashboard (optional): Streamlit or React for visualizing predictions, chains, and model performance
•Deployment: AWS or GCP (EC2, Lambda, Cloud Functions, S3 for storage)
•Version Control & CI/CD: GitHub, GitHub Actions

Output
•Structured prediction on likely stock movement (up/down/neutral)
•Confidence score
•Chain-of-reasoning summary
•Tag: perceived value vs proven value (based on historical analogs + financial health)
