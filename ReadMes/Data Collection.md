•Purpose: Validate the effectiveness of summarizations in capturing essential information and chains of impact.
•Input Needed: Original and summarized articles, annotated factors.
•Output: Comparative analysis of the accuracy and completeness of summarizations.

5.2. Major Events vs. All Events
•Purpose: Determine whether focusing on major events yields better insights than analyzing all events.
•Input Needed: Annotated articles categorized by event type (major vs. all events), stock data.
•Output: Comparative analysis of the impact of major events versus all events on stock prices.

6. Iterative Improvement

6.1. Process Refinement
•Purpose: Continuously improve the filtering, analysis, and integration processes based on feedback.
•Input Needed: Initial results, feedback from analyses, performance metrics.
•Output: Refined and optimized processes for future analysis.

6.2. Scaling Up
•Purpose: Gradually expand the analysis to more companies and longer timeframes.
•Input Needed: Successful implementation and validation of initial analysis, additional data for new companies and extended timeframes.
•Output: Scaled-up analysis covering more companies and extended periods.

7. Final Model Training and Deployment

7.1. Model Training
•Purpose: Train a comprehensive model with the complete processed dataset to predict stock movements.
•Input Needed: Final integrated dataset of news articles and stock data, labeled factors.
•Output: A trained predictive model ready for deployment.

7.2. Deployment
•Purpose: Implement the model for real-time analysis and prediction.
•Input Needed: Trained model, real-time data input mechanisms.
•Output: Real-time predictions of stock movements based on new news articles.
