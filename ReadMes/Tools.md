You’re on the right track with Morningstar and Alpha Vantage as potential sources for both historical stock data and company fundamentals, but let’s break down how well they align with your goals:

Morningstar
•Strengths:
•In-depth Company Analysis: Morningstar excels at offering detailed fundamental financial data, including company health, earnings, balance sheets, cash flows, and financial ratios. This makes it ideal for your goal of understanding long-term performance and distinguishing real value (tied to fundamentals) from perceived value (based on market hype).
•Historical Data: It provides long-term historical data for multiple years, which can help you assess which news events correlate with genuine improvements in business metrics.
•Portfolio Analysis: Morningstar also has tools to help weigh how certain factors influence investment performance, which is useful for testing whether news headlines actually led to value creation or were just speculative.
•Weaknesses:
•Lack of News Integration: While Morningstar offers a deep dive into financial health, it lacks robust news aggregation or analysis tools that can be easily tied to headlines. You would need to supplement it with a service like Alpha Vantage for tracking news-related stock movements.

Alpha Vantage
•Strengths:
•Historical Stock Data: Alpha Vantage offers long-term historical stock data, including pricing and volume. It’s useful for tracking movements after news events, especially when combined with its real-time data (even though you don’t need real-time now).
•News API: Alpha Vantage also provides access to news sentiment and headlines, which can be tied directly to stock movements. You can pull news by company, date, or keywords to analyze which types of headlines led to real value or were speculative.
•Affordable: It’s very affordable compared to other options like Bloomberg, and it offers more than just stock data, including company financials, technical indicators, and earnings data.
•Weaknesses:
•Less Depth on Fundamentals: While Alpha Vantage provides access to earnings and basic financials, it doesn’t go as deep into detailed company health (like Morningstar does) in areas such as cash flows, profitability, or advanced financial ratios.

Combined Use Case (Morningstar + Alpha Vantage)
•Alpha Vantage gives you historical stock data tied to news events, along with sentiment analysis of headlines. This is helpful to assess immediate market reactions and perceived value creation.
•Morningstar provides long-term financial fundamentals to see which news events actually led to sustained business improvement, allowing you to distinguish between real vs. speculative value.

Critical Evaluation:
•If you combine them: You’ll have both news-driven market data and deep company analysis. This will enable you to track short-term reactions (Alpha Vantage) while also verifying which events actually improved the company’s long-term financial health (Morningstar).
•If you choose only one: If you primarily want to see which headlines impacted stock prices, Alpha Vantage might suffice because it combines news and stock data. However, if your focus is more on long-term health and sustained value, Morningstar alone provides a better understanding of financial fundamentals.

Conclusion:

If budget allows, using both Morningstar and Alpha Vantage provides a comprehensive solution. Alpha Vantage will cover the news-to-stock reaction aspect, and Morningstar will help assess whether these events led to genuine business improvement over time. If you need to pick one based on your main goal (news impact or long-term financial health), go with Alpha Vantage if you prioritize news analysis, or Morningstar if deep financial insight is key.
