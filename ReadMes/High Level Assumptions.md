High Level Assumptions


High-Level Assumptions
1.Stock Movement Follows Public News
•Concept: Stock price changes occur after public news is released, not before (no insider information).
•Detailed Assumption: I can relate news article release times to intra-day stock movements.
•Test: Compare timestamps of news releases with stock price movements across several days.
2.News Articles Provide Sufficient Insight into Investor Decisions
•Concept: There are enough public news articles that reveal investor thought processes to break down how news affects investments.
•Detailed Assumption: News sources reliably capture the reasons behind investor decisions, covering different aspects like product launches or market trends.
•Test: Analyze historical news coverage and stock movements, then correlate explanations from articles with actual price movements.
3.Investor Decisions are Complex and Multi-Step
•Concept: Investors make decisions through multi-step reasoning that involves interpreting a chain of impacts (e.g., product release → increased demand → higher revenue → stock price rise).
•Detailed Assumption: I can map the chain of reasoning from news events to stock outcomes by studying past patterns.
•Test: Map out multi-step chains from historical data and identify patterns leading to stock movements.
4.Historical News Events are Predictors for New Events
•Concept: New news scenarios are combinations of previous ones, and historical reactions can help predict future ones.
•Detailed Assumption: I can use patterns from old news events to model and predict how new ones will impact stock price.
•Test: Compare new news events with historical scenarios and assess predictive accuracy based on past stock movements.

Detailed Assumptions
1.Relating News to Intra-Day Stock Movement
•Assumption: News article timestamps can be accurately correlated with intra-day stock movement.
•Test: Track intra-day stock prices and match significant price changes to news releases during the day.
2.Sufficient News Coverage to Analyze Investor Thinking
•Assumption: There are enough news articles that thoroughly explain investor sentiment and thought processes.
•Test: Analyze historical news related to major stock movements and check if articles provide reasons and rationale for those movements.
3.Multi-Step Decision Chains from News to Stock Movements
•Assumption: Investors follow a series of logical steps that lead from news release to stock decisions.
•Test: Build decision trees from historical news events and identify how each decision point (e.g., new product, regulatory change) led to subsequent stock movements.

By distinguishing high-level assumptions from more detailed ones, you can create a structured testing process to validate the entire model at both macro and micro levels.
