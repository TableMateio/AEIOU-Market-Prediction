# Lean Development Strategy: Build-Test-Learn for News-Driven Market Prediction

## üéØ Core Philosophy: Assumption-Driven Development

**RULE #1: Test Assumptions Before Building Systems**
- Every feature must validate a core assumption
- Build minimum viable tests, not minimum viable products
- Fail fast on wrong assumptions, don't polish broken concepts

**RULE #2: Manual Before Automated**
- If you can't do it manually with 90% accuracy, don't automate it
- Hand-label data before training models
- Human-in-the-loop validation for every automated process

**RULE #3: Data Quality > Model Sophistication**
- Clean, accurate data beats fancy algorithms
- 100 perfect examples > 10,000 noisy ones
- Validate every data source assumption immediately

**RULE #4: Evidence-Based Iteration**
- Every development cycle must answer: "What did we learn?"
- Quantify everything: precision, recall, false positive rates
- Kill features that don't demonstrably improve predictions

## Phase 1: Data Foundation - Validation Todos

### Week 1: Data Reality Check
**üéØ Goal**: Verify our data sources can actually support causal analysis

**Critical Assumption Tests**:

**DATA QUALITY LAYER**:
- [ ] **NEWS TIMING PRECISION**: Can we reliably correlate news timestamps to market movements?
  - Pull 10 major Apple events from last year
  - Check if Alpha Vantage news timestamps align with first price movements
  - Test: Does movement sometimes precede "official" news? (RED FLAG if yes)
  
- [ ] **NEWS COVERAGE COMPLETENESS**: Are we missing critical information?
  - Pick Apple iPhone 15 launch day
  - Compare Alpha Vantage coverage vs manual Bloomberg/Reuters search
  - Test: Do we capture at least 80% of major announcements?

**BUSINESS CAUSAL CHAIN LAYER**:
- [ ] **CAUSAL CHAIN EXTRACTION**: Can we reliably decompose news into business logic steps?
  - Take 10 major events, manually extract multi-step business chains
  - Test: Do 3 humans agree >70% on chain structure?
  - Example: "AI partnership" ‚Üí "capability boost ‚Üí UX improvement ‚Üí upgrade demand"

- [ ] **BUSINESS PATTERN MATCHING**: Do business patterns repeat across different events?
  - Identify 5 "feature_driven_refresh" patterns from 2020-2022
  - Find similar patterns in 2023 events
  - Test: Do pattern matches predict outcomes better than random?

**BELIEF FORMATION LAYER**:
- [ ] **BELIEF FACTOR EXTRACTION**: Can we measure atomic belief dimensions reliably?
  - Extract belief factors (intensity, certainty, duration) from 20 events
  - Test: Inter-annotator agreement >60% on belief scoring?
  - Validate: Do belief factors correlate with market reaction magnitude?

- [ ] **SOURCE CREDIBILITY IMPACT**: Does source credibility affect beliefs independent of content?
  - Find same event covered by Reuters vs Seeking Alpha
  - Test: Different belief factor scores for same content/different sources?

**Build Minimum**:
- [ ] Simple data ingestion script (Alpha Vantage + one backup source)
- [ ] Basic timestamp alignment between news and price data
- [ ] Manual verification dashboard for 20 events

**Success Criteria**: 
‚úÖ News-to-price correlation visible in >70% of major events
‚úÖ Timestamp accuracy within 30 minutes
‚úÖ Business causal chains extractable from >80% of major events
‚úÖ Belief factors show variance across different events/sources
‚ùå If we can't reliably connect news to price movements, STOP and fix data pipeline
‚ùå If causal chains are too vague or belief factors are random, PIVOT to simpler approach

### Week 2: Dual-Layer Manual Validation
**üéØ Goal**: Test if humans can reliably extract both business chains AND belief factors

**BUSINESS CAUSAL CHAIN VALIDATION**:

  - Take 5 major Apple events
  - Have 3 people extract complete business chains (2-5 steps each)
  - Test: >70% overlap in chain structure and step identification?

- [ ] **BUSINESS PATTERN CLASSIFICATION**: Can humans identify reusable patterns?
  - Have annotators classify chains into pattern types
  - Test: Do similar events generate similar pattern classifications?
  - Build initial taxonomy: feature_driven_refresh, partnership_leverage, etc.

**BELIEF FORMATION VALIDATION**:
- [ ] **BELIEF FACTOR SCORING CONSISTENCY**: Do humans score belief dimensions similarly?
  - Take same 5 events, have annotators score 10 belief dimensions
  - Test: <30% variance in belief factor scores across annotators?
  - Focus on: intensity_belief, certainty_level, believability_score

- [ ] **BELIEF-BUSINESS CORRELATION**: Do belief factors correlate with business impact?
  - Compare belief scores with actual business chain magnitude
  - Test: Higher certainty correlates with stronger business impacts?

**DUAL-LAYER INTEGRATION**:
- [ ] **LAYER INTERACTION**: Do business chains and belief factors interact meaningfully?
  - Test: Do complex chains get lower certainty scores?
  - Test: Do familiar patterns get higher believability scores?

**Build Minimum**:
- [ ] Dual-layer annotation tool (chains + beliefs)
- [ ] Standardized format for both layers
- [ ] Statistical correlation analysis between layers

**Success Criteria**:
‚úÖ Business chain extraction >70% consistency
‚úÖ Belief factor scoring <30% variance
‚úÖ Meaningful correlation between layers
‚ùå If either layer fails consistency tests

  - Run identical Apple event through GPT-4 ten times
  - Measure variance in: extracted factors, causal chains, sentiment
  - Test: <20% variance in key outputs?

- [ ] **CAUSAL HALLUCINATION CHECK**: Does GPT invent false causality?
  - Feed GPT articles about unrelated events (weather + Apple stock)
  - Test: Does it generate spurious causal connections?
  - Run articles through GPT in scrambled order
  - Test: Does temporal order affect causal reasoning?

- [ ] **FACTOR EXTRACTION ACCURACY**: Can GPT identify business impacts?
  - Compare GPT extraction vs manual annotation on 20 events
  - Test: >75% overlap in identified business factors?

**Critical Assumption Tests**:
- [ ] **SOURCE CREDIBILITY IMPACT**: Does source matter more than content?
  - Find identical news from different sources (Bloomberg vs blog)
  - Test: Different market reactions to same information?

- [ ] **VOLUME/VOLATILITY PROXIES**: Do trading patterns indicate belief?
  - Correlate unusual volume spikes with news events
  - Test: High volume = high market attention = higher belief?

- [ ] **FOLLOW-UP COVERAGE**: Does narrative persistence predict impact?
  - Track how long stories stay in news cycle
  - Test: Longer coverage = sustained price impact?

**Build Minimum**:
- [ ] Simple source credibility scoring (manual weights)
- [ ] Volume/volatility pattern detection
- [ ] Narrative persistence tracking

**Success Criteria**:
‚úÖ Clear correlation between source quality and market impact
‚úÖ Volume patterns distinguishable for "believed" vs "ignored" news
‚ùå If no clear patterns, believability may not be quantifiable

### Week 7: Investor Archetype Assumptions
**üéØ Goal**: Test if we can infer different investor behaviors

**Critical Assumption Tests**:
- [ ] **RETAIL VS INSTITUTIONAL SIGNALS**: Can we detect different reaction patterns?
  - Compare immediate (retail) vs delayed (institutional) reactions
  - Test: Different volume signatures for different investor types?

- [ ] **TIME-OF-DAY EFFECTS**: Do reactions vary by trading hour?
  - Check if morning news hits differently than after-hours
  - Test: Retail dominance in certain hours = different patterns?

**Build Minimum**:
- [ ] Time-series analysis of reaction patterns
- [ ] Volume signature clustering
- [ ] Simple archetype classification

**Success Criteria**:
‚úÖ Distinguishable patterns between investor types
‚úÖ Time-of-day effects measurable

## üîß Development Rules

1. **Build Evidence, Not Features**: Every commit must validate or refute an assumption
2. **Manual First**: If you can't do it by hand, don't automate it
3. **Small Data, Big Learning**: 100 perfect examples > 1000 messy ones
4. **Quantify Everything**: "It seems to work" isn't good enough
5. **Kill Bad Ideas Fast**: Don't polish something that doesn't work fundamentally
6. **Document Failures**: Failed assumptions are as valuable as successful ones

Remember: The goal isn't to build a perfect system, it's to build a system that works well enough to generate alpha. Better to have a simple, reliable 60% accuracy tool than a complex, unreliable 65% accuracy system.
