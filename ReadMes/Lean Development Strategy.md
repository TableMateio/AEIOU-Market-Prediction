# Lean Development Strategy: Build-Test-Learn for News-Driven Market Prediction

## üéØ Core Philosophy: Assumption-Driven Development

**RULE #1: Test Assumptions Before Building Systems**
- Every feature must validate a core assumption
- Build minimum viable tests, not minimum viable products
- Fail fast on wrong assumptions, don't polish broken concepts

**RULE #2: Manual Before Automated**
- If you can't do it manually with 90% accuracy, don't automate it
- Hand-label data before training models
- Human-in-the-loop validation for every automated process

**RULE #3: Data Quality > Model Sophistication**
- Clean, accurate data beats fancy algorithms
- 100 perfect examples > 10,000 noisy ones
- Validate every data source assumption immediately

**RULE #4: Evidence-Based Iteration**
- Every development cycle must answer: "What did we learn?"
- Quantify everything: precision, recall, false positive rates
- Kill features that don't demonstrably improve predictions

## Phase 1: Data Foundation - Validation Todos

### Week 1: Data Reality Check
**üéØ Goal**: Verify our data sources can actually support causal analysis

**Critical Assumption Tests**:
- [ ] **NEWS TIMING PRECISION**: Can we reliably correlate news timestamps to market movements?
  - Pull 10 major Apple events from last year
  - Check if Alpha Vantage news timestamps align with first price movements
  - Test: Does movement sometimes precede "official" news? (RED FLAG if yes)
  
- [ ] **NEWS COVERAGE COMPLETENESS**: Are we missing critical information?
  - Pick Apple iPhone 15 launch day
  - Compare Alpha Vantage coverage vs manual Bloomberg/Reuters search
  - Test: Do we capture at least 80% of major announcements?

- [ ] **STOCK DATA ACCURACY**: Is intraday data precise enough?
  - Cross-validate Alpha Vantage vs Yahoo Finance for 5 trading days
  - Check: Do we have minute-level data during news events?
  - Test: Can we identify the 30-minute window when news "hit" the market?

**Build Minimum**:
- [ ] Simple data ingestion script (Alpha Vantage + one backup source)
- [ ] Basic timestamp alignment between news and price data
- [ ] Manual verification dashboard for 20 events

**Success Criteria**: 
‚úÖ News-to-price correlation visible in >70% of major events
‚úÖ Timestamp accuracy within 30 minutes
‚ùå If we can't reliably connect news to price movements, STOP and fix data pipeline

### Week 2: Manual Causal Chain Validation
**üéØ Goal**: Test if humans can reliably extract causal chains before automating

**Critical Assumption Tests**:
- [ ] **CAUSAL CHAIN CONSISTENCY**: Do different humans extract similar chains?
  - Take 5 major Apple events
  - Have 3 people manually extract causal chains
  - Test: >60% overlap in identified causal links?

- [ ] **SUFFICIENT INFORMATION**: Do news articles contain enough detail?
  - Manually analyze 10 events that moved stock >5%
  - Test: Can you trace a logical path from news to business impact?
  - RED FLAG: If most chains require external knowledge not in articles

**Build Minimum**:
- [ ] Manual annotation tool for causal chains
- [ ] Standardized format for chain documentation
- [ ] Inter-annotator agreement measurement

**Success Criteria**:
‚úÖ Manual causal chain extraction achievable with >60% consistency
‚úÖ Clear patterns emerge across similar event types
‚ùå If humans can't agree on chains, GPT-4 will be worse

## Phase 2: NLP Pipeline - GPT Reality Check

### Week 3: GPT-4 Consistency Testing
**üéØ Goal**: Validate GPT-4 can reliably extract causal information

**Critical Assumption Tests**:
- [ ] **GPT CONSISTENCY TEST**: Same input = similar output?
  - Run identical Apple event through GPT-4 ten times
  - Measure variance in: extracted factors, causal chains, sentiment
  - Test: <20% variance in key outputs?

- [ ] **CAUSAL HALLUCINATION CHECK**: Does GPT invent false causality?
  - Feed GPT articles about unrelated events (weather + Apple stock)
  - Test: Does it generate spurious causal connections?
  - Run articles through GPT in scrambled order
  - Test: Does temporal order affect causal reasoning?

- [ ] **FACTOR EXTRACTION ACCURACY**: Can GPT identify business impacts?
  - Compare GPT extraction vs manual annotation on 20 events
  - Test: >75% overlap in identified business factors?

**Build Minimum**:
- [ ] Simple GPT-4 prompt for causal chain extraction
- [ ] Batch processing for consistency testing
- [ ] Comparison metrics vs human annotation

**Success Criteria**:
‚úÖ GPT-4 consistency >80% on repeated runs
‚úÖ Matches human annotation >75% on factor identification
‚ùå If GPT is unreliable, switch to rule-based extraction + human oversight

### Week 4: Historical Pattern Validity
**üéØ Goal**: Test if "past predicts future" assumption holds

**Critical Assumption Tests**:
- [ ] **PATTERN STABILITY**: Do historical patterns repeat?
  - Identify 5 "product launch" events from 2020-2022
  - Find similar events in 2023
  - Test: Do similar patterns produce similar outcomes?

- [ ] **MARKET REGIME SENSITIVITY**: Do patterns break during different market conditions?
  - Test same event type during bull vs bear markets
  - Check: Do causal chains change based on market regime?

**Build Minimum**:
- [ ] Pattern matching algorithm (simple similarity search)
- [ ] Historical analog database for 50 events
- [ ] Prediction accuracy tracking

**Success Criteria**:
‚úÖ Historical analogs predict direction correctly >60% of time
‚úÖ Patterns show some stability across time periods
‚ùå If patterns are random, need to rethink fundamental approach

## Phase 3: Belief & Perception Modeling - Proxy Validation

### Week 5-6: Believability Scoring
**üéØ Goal**: Test if we can quantify market "belief" in narratives

**Critical Assumption Tests**:
- [ ] **SOURCE CREDIBILITY IMPACT**: Does source matter more than content?
  - Find identical news from different sources (Bloomberg vs blog)
  - Test: Different market reactions to same information?

- [ ] **VOLUME/VOLATILITY PROXIES**: Do trading patterns indicate belief?
  - Correlate unusual volume spikes with news events
  - Test: High volume = high market attention = higher belief?

- [ ] **FOLLOW-UP COVERAGE**: Does narrative persistence predict impact?
  - Track how long stories stay in news cycle
  - Test: Longer coverage = sustained price impact?

**Build Minimum**:
- [ ] Simple source credibility scoring (manual weights)
- [ ] Volume/volatility pattern detection
- [ ] Narrative persistence tracking

**Success Criteria**:
‚úÖ Clear correlation between source quality and market impact
‚úÖ Volume patterns distinguishable for "believed" vs "ignored" news
‚ùå If no clear patterns, believability may not be quantifiable

### Week 7: Investor Archetype Assumptions
**üéØ Goal**: Test if we can infer different investor behaviors

**Critical Assumption Tests**:
- [ ] **RETAIL VS INSTITUTIONAL SIGNALS**: Can we detect different reaction patterns?
  - Compare immediate (retail) vs delayed (institutional) reactions
  - Test: Different volume signatures for different investor types?

- [ ] **TIME-OF-DAY EFFECTS**: Do reactions vary by trading hour?
  - Check if morning news hits differently than after-hours
  - Test: Retail dominance in certain hours = different patterns?

**Build Minimum**:
- [ ] Time-series analysis of reaction patterns
- [ ] Volume signature clustering
- [ ] Simple archetype classification

**Success Criteria**:
‚úÖ Distinguishable patterns between investor types
‚úÖ Time-of-day effects measurable
‚ùå If all reactions look the same, archetype modeling may be futile

## üîß Development Rules

1. **Build Evidence, Not Features**: Every commit must validate or refute an assumption
2. **Manual First**: If you can't do it by hand, don't automate it
3. **Small Data, Big Learning**: 100 perfect examples > 1000 messy ones
4. **Quantify Everything**: "It seems to work" isn't good enough
5. **Kill Bad Ideas Fast**: Don't polish something that doesn't work fundamentally
6. **Document Failures**: Failed assumptions are as valuable as successful ones

Remember: The goal isn't to build a perfect system, it's to build a system that works well enough to generate alpha. Better to have a simple, reliable 60% accuracy tool than a complex, unreliable 65% accuracy system.
