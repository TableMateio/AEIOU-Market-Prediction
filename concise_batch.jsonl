You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does

Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*:

Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections**

breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this

value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: The Dinosaur In The Room: Huntingtown Man Charged With Stalking After Allegedly Hiding AirTag In Child's Toy - The BayNet\nSource: The Bay Net\nPublished: 2025-08-11T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://thebaynet.com/the-dinosaur-in-the-room-huntingtown-man-charged-with-stalking-after-allegedly-hiding-airtag-in-childs-toy/\n\nBody:\nPRINCE FREDERICK, Md. -- A 35-year-old Huntingtown man is facing a stalking charge after he allegedly hid an Apple AirTag inside a stuffed dinosaur he had given to his child, in an apparent attempt to track the location of the child's mother. The investigation began on June 8, 2025, when a woman in Owings contacted the Calvert County Sheriff's Office with her suspicions. According to the statement of probable cause, the responding deputy, J. MacWilliams, launched a detailed investigation after the mother gave him consent to cut open the red stuffed dinosaur. After removing handfuls of stuffing, the deputy located the AirTag hidden deep inside the toy. A subpoena was served to Apple Inc. on June 20, 2025. On July 10, Apple provided data that linked the device's serial number to an Apple ID, phone numbers and a residential address belonging to the child's father, Jesse Patrick Goble. The data confirmed the AirTag was activated on June 7 and unpaired on June 8, at the exact time the deputy had taken possession of the dinosaur. When contacted by phone on June 16, Goble denied knowing about any AirTag inside the toy. This was not Goble's first law enforcement encounter related to the victim; court records show he was already facing charges filed on May 30, 2025, for allegedly violating a peace order and for harassment stemming from a separate incident on May 27, 2025. Goble now faces a new charge of stalking. In Maryland, a conviction for the misdemeanor carries a maximum penalty of up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. An arrest warrant was served on July 31, 2025, and Goble was subsequently released on his own recognizance. A trial is scheduled for Sept. 8, 2025.\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms; Product_Launch = availability; M&A = deal completion/announcement; etc.)"},"trigger":{"type":"string","description":"How the news surfaced","enum":["press_release","earnings_call","filing","analyst_report","media_report","rumor","social","other"]},"entities":{"type":"array","description":"Companies or organizations involved","items":{"type":"string"}},"scope":{"type":"string","description":"Impacted scope","enum":["company","industry"]},"orientation":{"type":"string","description":"Perspective","enum":["predictive","reflective","both","neutral"]},"time_horizon_days":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"description":"Overall relevance window of this event in days"},"tags":{"type":"array","description":"Reusable tags (e.g., company, product name, quoted people, themes like 'supply chain', 'innovation')","items":{"type":"string"}},"quoted_people":{"type":"array","description":"Individuals quoted in the article (separate from authors)","items":{"type":"string"}},"event_description":{"type":"string","description":"Optional natural-language summary of the top-level event"},"causal_chain":{"type":"array","description":"Sequence of causal steps; step=0 is the triggering event.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes

effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild

(conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*:

Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current narrative)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Regime-neutral (independent of market context)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Slightly counter-regime (mild contradiction to sentiment)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Moderately counter-regime (challenges current narrative)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Strongly counter-regime (good news in bear market, bad news in bull market)\n\n#### Reframing Potential (0–1)\nHow easily can this event be reframed to fit dominant narrative.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly reframable (ambiguous interpretation, easily spun either way)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderately reframable (some spin possible with context)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Somewhat reframable (limited interpretation flexibility)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited reframing options (fairly clear implications)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Hard facts (difficult to

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n• **0.26–0.50** = Business model transformation\n• **0.51–1.00** = Company reinvention (reserved for cars, healthcare, AI breakthroughs)\n\n### Calibration Examples:\n• **iPhone 15 launch**: 0.02-0.03 (incremental refresh)\n• **Apple Watch launch**: 0.05-0.08 (new category)\n• **Services push**: 0.08-0.12 (business model shift)\n• **Vision Pro**: 0.03-0.06 (early-stage new category)\n• **Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/sonny-is-exactly-what-los-angeles-fc-and-mls-need\n\nBody:\nLOS ANGELES - When Son Heung-min was substituted in his final game for Tottenham Hotspur after a decade last Sunday, it took more than three minutes for him to get through the hugs and applause from all the players and leave the pitch. The hugely popular South Korean attacker helped define an era at the English Premier League club, and he'll be deeply missed by teammates, staff and Spurs fans. Son is joining Los Angeles FC for a record fee in Major League Soccer of about US$26 million - more than the total wage bill of the West Coast club, according to the Los Angeles Times. That might seem like a gamble on a 33-year-old whose trademark speed has started to fade, but his grace, technique and composure should still see him light up a team that has struggled for goals this season. And that's barely half the story. What makes this a truly astute move for LAFC is Son's immensely bankable star power. His name might be less familiar to many Americans than Lionel Messi or David Beckham, but in South Korea and among its diaspora, his celebrity and reputation is almost unsurpassed. Son's move should be a shot in the arm not just for LAFC on the pitch, but also for MLS as the sport scrambles to build interest and capitalize on next year's World Cup being held in the US, Canada and Mexico. It's hard to overstate Son's importance to Tottenham over the past decade - on the field and off. Off the pitch, he has built a huge following for Spurs among Korean fans. Thousands attend Spurs matches, and \"Son\" named team shirts outsell all others with as many as 700 being shifted on matchdays, according to The Athletic. In Korea itself, one-quarter of the 51 million population claimed to be Spurs fans in 2022, according to research commissioned by the insurance company and team sponsor AIA Group Ltd. All this is worth up to US$80 million in revenue per season, according to an estimate in the Daily Mail. America is about to get a taste of this fervor. Los Angeles County is home to the biggest Korean population outside the country itself. The community has been buzzing since rumors of his move began, Kyeongjun Kim, a writer with the biggest US Korean-language news organization told the LA Times. \"The passion and influence of Korean and Korean-American soccer fans should never be underestimated,\" Kim said. \"Son's arrival at LAFC will benefit not only the club but the league as a whole.\" And MLS could do with a boost. There have been grumbles from club bosses about viewer numbers since Apple Inc. paid US$2.5 billion for 10 years of exclusive broadcast rights and made it available only to streaming subscribers. League commissioner Don Garber revealed for the first time last month that games were attracting about 120,000 unique viewers to Apple TV. These numbers aren't comparable to audited linear TV figures, so the revelation prompted confusion, but many in the sport are convinced that audiences have shrunk compared with what games on ESPN used to attract. Another worry is that Messi will retire soon. The Argentinian lifted match attendances and sponsorship money across MLS on joining Inter Miami in 2023. When the 38-year-old finally stops playing, fans and brands could drift away, too. This happened when Beckham left LA Galaxy in 2012. Despite Miami's rapid growth since Messi arrived and league-leading revenue of US$180 million last year, the Florida club remains second to LAFC in the Forbes ranking of most valuable MLS franchises. Worries about whether it can keep these commercial gains hold Miami back. Bringing older star names to American soccer to win supporters and audiences has long been the US model: Before Messi there was the imperious Zlatan Ibrahimovic and way before Beckham there was Pele. But Sonny's fanbase and commercial clout trumps many of these names. It remains to be seen what the future holds but one thing for sure, Sonny playing in the MLS will definitely be a plus to the league.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

bold moves, accepting volatility)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderate risk acceptance (calculated risks, measured optimism)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Balanced approach (weighing pros and cons equally)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Risk-averse (preferring proven approaches, cautious outlook)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Very conservative (avoiding uncertainty, safety-first mentality)\n• **0.0**: Risk-avoidant (rejecting any uncertainty or downside potential)\n\n### Temporal Factors\n\n#### Duration Expectation (0–1)\nPerceived longevity of the issue or its effects.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Permanent/structural (fundamental business model shifts)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Long-term (multi-year implications)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Medium-term (1-2 year effects)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Short-term (quarterly to annual impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Brief impact (weeks to months)\n• **0.0**: Fleeting (daily news cycle, minimal lasting effect)\n\n#### Urgency (0–1)\nHow immediately people think action or attention is required.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate action required (\"must respond today\")\n• **0.7–0.8**: High urgency (\"needs prompt attention\")\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate urgency (\"should address soon\")\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low urgency (\"can wait for

major outlets, significant sharing)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate coverage (industry media, some social traction)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited coverage (niche outlets, minimal sharing)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal amplification (single source, little pickup)\n• **0.0**: No amplification (buried news, no social traction)\n\n### Emotional Profile (Array)\nSelect applicable emotions detected in the narrative. Multiple simultaneous emotions are common.\n\n**Core Emotions**: anticipation, excitement, optimism, confidence, relief, satisfaction, interest, surprise, uncertainty, concern, skepticism, disappointment, fear, anger, disgust, indifference\n\n**Market-Specific Emotions**: FOMO (fear of missing out), greed, euphoria, panic, dread, complacency\n\n**Examples**:\n• Accessory launch = [\"indifference\"]\n• AI breakthrough = [\"excitement\", \"anticipation\", \"FOMO\"]\n• Supply chain disruption = [\"concern\", \"uncertainty\"]\n• Competitive threat = [\"fear\", \"skepticism\"]\n\n### Cognitive Biases (Array)\nList identifiable psychological biases influencing interpretation.

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current

Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n•

breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Trump urges 'conflicted' Intel CEO Tan Lip-Bu to resign immediately\nSource: The Straits Times\nPublished: 2025-08-08T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-urges-conflicted-intel-ceo-tan-lip-bu-to-resign-immediately\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump called on the chief executive officer of Intel Corp Tan Lip-Bu to resign because of what he called conflicts of interest, adding to the challenges for a company that is supposed to anchor restoration of the US semiconductor industry. \"The CEO of INTEL is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,\" Mr Trump wrote on Truth Social on Aug 7. \"There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!\" Intel said in a statement on Aug 7: \"Intel, The Board of Directors, and Lip-Bu Tan are deeply committed to advancing US national and economic security interests and are making significant investments aligned with the President's America First agenda. \"We look forward to our continued engagement with the Administration.\" This week, Republican Senator Tom Cotton asked the chairman of Intel's board to answer questions about Mr Tan's ties to China , including investments in the country's semiconductor companies and others with connections to the country's military. In a letter to Mr Frank Yeary, who oversees the chipmaker's board of directors, Mr Cotton asked about investments Mr Tan made in China before he was picked to run Intel. Mr Cotton noted specific concerns about Mr Tan's ties to Cadence Design Systems Inc, a tech company he led for over a decade which sold products to a Chinese military university. The company pleaded guilty in July to violating US export controls by selling hardware and software to China's National University of Defence Technology. Mr Tan is an industry veteran in technology and venture capital. During his 12 years as CEO of Cadence, which he joined in 2008 when the chip-design software company was struggling, the company's share price grew more than 3,000 per cent. Mr Tan, 65, took the reins at Intel in March, seeking to turn around the iconic chipmaker after it had lost ground to rivals in recent years. Intel is a critical piece of Washington's efforts to rebuild the domestic semiconductor industry. The company had been awarded almost US$8 billion (S$10.27 billion) from the Chips and Science Act for US investments, including a facility to supply the US military, although the Trump administration is making changes to the programme. The Santa Clara, California-based company long led the semiconductor market by producing faster and faster chips to power personal computers and laptops, but it struggled as computing migrated to smartphones and artificial intelligence has grown in importance. Nvidia Corp has pioneered AI chips development, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co has become the world's biggest semiconductor producer by manufacturing chips for companies like Nvidia and Apple Inc. Intel's market valuation was about US$89 billion as of Aug 6's closing price compared with US$4.4 trillion for Nvidia. Malaysian-born Tan has vowed to spin off Intel assets that aren't central to its mission and create more compelling products. He has pushed a plan to slash jobs and delayed or cancelled projects to reduce operating expenses. \"Intel and Mr Tan are deeply committed to the national security of the United States and the integrity of our role in the US defence ecosystem,\" the company said in a statement on Aug 6. Intel said it would address the matters in the letter with the senator. Intel shares fell 3.8 per cent in premarket trading before markets opened in New York.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n####

effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does

(conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: If chip firm builds US plant during Trump's term, no tariff will apply: Lutnick\nSource: Social News XYZ\nPublished: 2025-08-08T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.socialnews.xyz/2025/08/08/if-chip-firm-builds-us-plant-during-trumps-term-no-tariff-will-apply-lutnick/\n\nBody:\nWashington, Aug 8 (SocialNews.XYZ) If a semiconductor firm commits to building its factory in the United States during President Donald Trump's term and fulfills the commitment, its chips would not face a tariff, the commerce secretary said, a day after Trump unveiled a plan to impose about a 100 per cent tariff on chip imports. Secretary Howard Lutnick made the remarks during a Fox Business interview as South Korean tech firms, Samsung Electronics and SK hynix have been carefully watching his tariff policy developments, reports Yonhap news agency. \"So (what) the president said is if you commit to build in America during his term, and if you file it with the Commerce Department and if your auditor oversees you building it all the way through, then he will allow you to import your chips -- while you are building -- without a tariff,\" he said. \"But you have to be confirmed and overseen building in America,\" he added. Trump's announcement on the new tariff came after he said Tuesday that his administration plans to announce sector-specific tariffs \"within the next week or so.\" Some observers raised the possibility that Samsung Electronics and SK hynix could avoid the new tariff as they have been working on their investment plans in Texas and Indiana, respectively. To impose the tariff on semiconductor imports, Trump has invoked Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a law that provides the president with the authority to adjust imports into the U.S. when he determines they threaten to impair national security. Meanwhile, Seoul shares extended losses late Friday morning following a mixed close on Wall Street as uncertainties surrounding U.S. import tariffs weighed on investor sentiment. The benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) fell 12.80 points, or 0.4 percent, to 3,214.88 as of 11:20 a.m. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.51 percent to 43,968.64, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.35 percent to 21,242.70. Among gainers, tech giant Samsung Electronics rose 1.84 percent, and its chipmaking rival SK hynix climbed 0.19 percent.

{"custom_id":"art_6fc1d8e9-e67d-4010-b3bd-f23d7b07ad39","method":"POST","url":"/v1/chat/completions","body":{"model":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","temperature":0,"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"# AI Agent Instructions: Article → Structured JSON\n\n## Context: What You Are Doing\n\nYou are not just summarizing news. You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

markets with general optimism, growth expectations\n• **bear**: Declining markets with pessimism, contraction fears\n• **neutral**: Stable or mixed market conditions, balanced sentiment\n• **unknown**: Market regime signals present but unclear/conflicting\n• **null**: No market regime context determinable from article\n\n### Regime Sensitivity Factors\nFor each step in causal chains, assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current narrative)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Regime-neutral (independent of market context)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Slightly counter-regime (mild contradiction to sentiment)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Moderately counter-regime (challenges current narrative)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Strongly counter-regime (good news in bear market, bad news in bull market)\n\n#### Reframing Potential (0–1)\nHow easily can this event be reframed to fit dominant narrative.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly reframable (ambiguous interpretation, easily spun either way)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderately reframable (some spin possible with

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n•

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Trump eyes 100% chips tariff, but 0% for US investors like Apple\nSource: ArcaMax\nPublished: 2025-08-07T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-3804069\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON -- Donald Trump said he would impose a 100% tariff on imports that include semiconductors, but would exempt companies moving production back to the United States, as Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook and the president announced a fresh $100 billion investment plan from the Oval Office. \"We're going to be putting a very large tariff on chips and semiconductors, but the good news for companies like Apple is, if you're building in the United States, or have committed to build, without question, committed to build in the United States, there will be no charge,\" Trump told reporters. \"So in other words, we'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors. But if you're building in the United States of America, there's no charge,\" Trump said. \"Even though you're building and you're not producing yet, in terms of the big numbers of jobs and all of things building, if you're building, there will be no charge.\" The announcement amounts to a major victory for Apple and Cook, who have faced escalating threats from Trump's tariffs that threatened to ratchet up the cost of producing their signature phones and computers. Apple's $100 billion U.S. investment will include a new manufacturing program designed to bring more of Apple's production to the U.S. The company's American Manufacturing Program partners include glassmaker Corning Inc., Applied Materials Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and others, the company said. Corning will dedicate an entire factory in Kentucky to Apple glass production, increasing that company's workforce in the state by 50%, the iPhone maker said. Corning was already a supplier to Apple, making glass for the very first iPhone at the same factory. Apple had previously pledged to spend $500 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, a slight acceleration over its prior investments and previously announced plans, adding about $39 billion in spending and an additional 1,000 jobs annually. The announcement will bring Apple's cumulative commitment to $600 billion. The previously planned $500 billion is said to include work on a new server manufacturing facility in Houston, a supplier academy in Michigan and additional spending with its existing suppliers in the country. The increased pledge comes as Trump escalates a tariff push that's set to raise costs for Apple throughout its international supply chains. Trump plans to whack India -- a key production market for Apple -- with 50% tariffs, the first half of which takes effect just after midnight alongside a raft of other country-specific levies designed to reduce trade imbalances. The other half, to penalize India for buying Russian energy, will take effect later this month. The president has said he could unveil separate levies on all products containing semiconductor chips as soon as next week. Cook, who attended the president's inauguration and donated to his inaugural committee, has pushed for tariff exemptions for his company's iPhones. Most iPhones sold in the US come from India, while the bulk of other products, including Apple Watches, iPads and MacBooks, are manufactured in Vietnam, which was hit with a 20% tariff. While details of those tariffs -- and how firms would qualify for exemptions -- have yet to be released, Trump singled out Cook's Apple as an example of how to avoid the increased levies. Cook's investment echoes dozens of pledges from companies since Trump won the 2024 presidential election, with CEOs flying to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, and then to the White House once he was sworn in, to court the new administration and announce hundreds of billions of dollars worth of new deals. Many of these investments were already in the works prior to the November election, or were on par with previous investment trends, Bloomberg previously reported. Economists have also questioned whether all of the pledged spending, and associated job opportunities, will come to fruition. Apple's promised investments, while substantial, fall short of the full shift to US-based production that Trump and top White House officials have envisioned and encouraged. Earlier this year, the president threatened to impose a tariff of at least 25% on Apple if it didn't move manufacturing of the iPhone to the US, a day after he met with Cook at the White House. Cook told the president that final iPhone assembly \"will be elsewhere for a while,\" though highlighted that several components are being made in the US. Trump, seemingly satisfied, praised the Apple leader's plans. \"Look, he's not making this kind of an investment anywhere in the world, not even close,\" Trump said of Cook. \"He's coming back. I mean, Apple's coming back to America.\"\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms; Product_Launch = availability; M&A = deal completion/announcement; etc.)"},"trigger":{"type":"string","description":"How the news surfaced","enum":["press_release","earnings_call","filing","analyst_report","media_report","rumor","social","other"]},"entities":{"type":"array","description":"Companies or organizations involved","items":{"type":"string"}},"scope":{"type":"string","description":"Impacted scope","enum":["company","industry"]},"orientation":{"type":"string","description":"Perspective","enum":["predictive","reflective","both","neutral"]},"time_horizon_days":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"description":"Overall relevance window of this event in days"},"tags":{"type":"array","description":"Reusable tags (e.g., company, product name, quoted people, themes like 'supply chain', 'innovation')","items":{"type":"string"}},"quoted_people":{"type":"array","description":"Individuals quoted in the article (separate from authors)","items":{"type":"string"}},"event_description":{"type":"string","description":"Optional natural-language summary of the top-level event"},"causal_chain":{"type":"array","description":"Sequence of causal steps; step=0 is the triggering event.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this

Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Apple expands iPhone glass deal to avoid tariffs\nSource: The Star \nPublished: 2025-08-07T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2025/08/08/apple-expands-iphone-glass-deal-to-avoid-tariffs\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON: Apple Inc chief executive officer (CEO) Tim Cook is using a familiar strategy to stay in Donald Trump's good graces: expanding existing initiatives to show he supports the president's \"Made in the USA\" agenda. Standing in the Oval Office on Wednesday between Trump and vice-president JD Vance, Cook announced that Apple would increase its US investment commitment to US$600bil over four years - up from the US$500bil pledged after Trump's second-term victory. A centrepiece of the expansion is a US$2.5bil investment into Corning Inc, Apple's longtime glass supplier. For the first time, the cover glass for all iPhones and Apple Watches will be manufactured in the United States, at Corning's facility in Kentucky. Though Apple has touted the US roots of iPhone glass before, a portion of that glass was previously made overseas. \"Apple's been an investor in other countries a little bit. I won't say which ones, but a couple. And they're coming home,\" Trump said when making the announcement. The US$600bil investment, he said, is \"the biggest there is.\" The iPhone maker also discussed increased agreements focused on semiconductor manufacturing, expanding deals with partners like Samsung Electronics Co, Texas Instruments Inc and Broadcom Inc. Apple is branding the effort the American Manufacturing Programme, or AMP. In all, the announcements provided just enough evidence that Apple was focusing on America - without forcing it to make major changes. Corning has supplied Apple since the first iPhone in 2007, and Cook has long promoted the iPhone's American-made glass. What's new is the modestly increased scale. Apple is pointing to the deals as it seeks relief from looming tariffs. The Trump administration is letting exemptions on smartphone and gadget levies expire and adopting new duties on Indian imports - a potential issue for Apple, which recently shifted US-bound iPhone assembly to India. Cook even seized on Trump's famous love of gold. He presented the president with a large, circular Corning glass plaque engraved with the president's name, mounted in 24-karat gold. The Apple CEO said that the glass came off an assembly line in Kentucky while the gold was produced in Utah. Cook added that a former US Marine who works at Apple designed the plaque. Trump announced a major enticement - companies investing in the United States - even if the projects are in early stages, would get a break from some tariffs. \"The good news for companies like Apple is, if you're building in the United States, or have committed to build,\" Trump said, \"there will be no charge.\" Apple's pledges are expected to meet that criteria, even if it isn't actually making iPhones and other popular devices in the United States. Assembly of the smartphone - a costly and complex process of combining components, testing and boxing devices - will continue in China and, increasingly, India. That part will stay \"elsewhere for a while,\" Cook said. But \"there's a lot of content in there from the United States, and we're very proud of it.\" Trump acknowledged that assembly was \"set up in other places, and it's been there for a long time,\" but he reiterated his desire to bring that stage of production to the United States someday. \"This is a significant step toward the ultimate goal of ensuring that iPhones sold in the United States also are made in America,\" he said. Trump's existing tariffs have already taken a toll on Apple. It said last week that the levies would cost the company about US$1.1bil in the September quarter. But Apple is looking to avoid incurring further costs, especially as it prepares to unveil the iPhone 17 line next month. Cook is also likely seeking support from Trump on other fronts: The US Justice Department is suing the company for alleged antitrust violations, and the agency is threatening its US$20bil search deal with Alphabet Inc's Google in a separate case. The US government also could potentially help Apple cope with tough new restrictions on the App Store in the European Union. This isn't the first time Apple has used US manufacturing announcements to promote Trump's priorities. In 2019, the company promised to assemble a new Mac Pro in Texas. It wasn't a big change: Apple had produced the previous model in the state since 2013. But that gesture helped land the company a reprieve from tariffs. Earlier this year, after Trump's return to office, Cook unveiled the initial US$500bil commitment - an acceleration of the investments Apple had begun under President Joe Biden.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

markets with general optimism, growth expectations\n• **bear**: Declining markets with pessimism, contraction fears\n• **neutral**: Stable or mixed market conditions, balanced sentiment\n• **unknown**: Market regime signals present but unclear/conflicting\n• **null**: No market regime context determinable from article\n\n### Regime Sensitivity Factors\nFor each step in causal chains, assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current narrative)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Regime-neutral (independent of market context)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Slightly counter-regime (mild contradiction to sentiment)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Moderately counter-regime (challenges current narrative)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Strongly counter-regime (good news in bear market, bad news in bull market)\n\n#### Reframing Potential (0–1)\nHow easily can this event be reframed to fit dominant narrative.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly reframable (ambiguous interpretation, easily spun either way)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderately reframable (some spin possible with

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n•

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

is expected to celebrate at the White House a commitment by Apple to increase its U.S. investments by an additional $100 billion over the next four years. \"Today´s announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America´s economic and national security,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. Apple had previously said it intended to invest $500 billion domestically, a figure it will now increase to $600 billion. Trump in recent months has criticized the tech company and its CEO, Tim Cook, for efforts to shift iPhone production to India to avoid the tariffs his Republican administration had planned for China. While in Qatar earlier this year, Trump said there was \"a little problem\" with Apple and recalled a conversation with Cook in which he said he told the CEO, \"I don´t want you building in India.\" India has incurred Trump´s wrath, as the president signed an order Wednesday to put an additional 25% tariff on the world´s most populous country for its use of Russian oil. The new import taxes to be imposed in 21 days could put the combined tariffs on Indian goods at 50%. As part of the Apple announcement, the investments will be about bringing more of its supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S. FILE - An Apple store employee stands inside the store in New York on Feb. 5, 2021.

You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild

(conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*:

Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly

Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Trump will highlight Apple's plans to invest $100B more in U.S.\nSource: Spectrum News Bay News 9\nPublished: 2025-08-06T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://baynews9.com/fl/tampa/politics/2025/08/06/trump-apple--100-billion-u-s--investment\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday is expected to celebrate at the White House a commitment by Apple to increase its U.S. investments by an additional $100 billion over the next four years. \"Today's announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America's economic and national security,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. Apple had previously said it intended to invest $500 billion domestically, a figure it will now increase to $600 billion. Trump in recent months has criticized the tech company and its CEO, Tim Cook, for efforts to shift iPhone production to India to avoid the tariffs his Republican administration had planned for China. While in Qatar earlier this year, Trump said there was \"a little problem\" with Apple and recalled a conversation with Cook in which he said he told the CEO, \"I don't want you building in India.\" India has incurred Trump's wrath, as the president signed an order Wednesday to put an additional 25% tariff on the world's most populous country for its use of Russian oil. The new import taxes to be imposed in 21 days could put the combined tariffs on Indian goods at 50%. As part of the Apple announcement, the investments will be about bringing more of its supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S. Apple Inc., which is based in Cupertino, California, didn't immediately comment Wednesday. Bloomberg News first reported the announcement of Apple's additional investment commitment.\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms; Product_Launch = availability; M&A = deal completion/announcement; etc.)"},"trigger":{"type":"string","description":"How the news surfaced","enum":["press_release","earnings_call","filing","analyst_report","media_report","rumor","social","other"]},"entities":{"type":"array","description":"Companies or organizations involved","items":{"type":"string"}},"scope":{"type":"string","description":"Impacted scope","enum":["company","industry"]},"orientation":{"type":"string","description":"Perspective","enum":["predictive","reflective","both","neutral"]},"time_horizon_days":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"description":"Overall relevance window of this event in days"},"tags":{"type":"array","description":"Reusable tags (e.g., company, product name, quoted people, themes like 'supply chain', 'innovation')","items":{"type":"string"}},"quoted_people":{"type":"array","description":"Individuals quoted in the article (separate from authors)","items":{"type":"string"}},"event_description":{"type":"string","description":"Optional natural-language summary of the top-level event"},"causal_chain":{"type":"array","description":"Sequence of causal steps; step=0 is the triggering event.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes

effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild

(conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*:

Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current narrative)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Regime-neutral (independent of market context)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Slightly counter-regime (mild contradiction to sentiment)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Moderately counter-regime (challenges current narrative)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Strongly counter-regime (good news in bear market, bad news in bull market)\n\n#### Reframing Potential (0–1)\nHow easily can this event be reframed to fit dominant narrative.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly reframable (ambiguous interpretation, easily spun either way)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderately reframable (some spin possible with context)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Somewhat reframable (limited interpretation flexibility)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited reframing options (fairly clear implications)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Hard facts (difficult to

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n• **0.26–0.50** = Business model transformation\n• **0.51–1.00** = Company reinvention (reserved for cars, healthcare, AI breakthroughs)\n\n### Calibration Examples:\n• **iPhone 15 launch**: 0.02-0.03 (incremental refresh)\n• **Apple Watch launch**: 0.05-0.08 (new category)\n• **Services push**: 0.08-0.12 (business model shift)\n• **Vision Pro**: 0.03-0.06 (early-stage new category)\n• **Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America's economic and national security,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. Apple had previously said it intended to invest $500 billion domestically, a figure it will now increase to $600 billion. Trump in recent months has criticized the tech company and its CEO, Tim Cook, for efforts to shift iPhone production to India to avoid the tariffs his Republican administration had planned for China. While in Qatar earlier this year, Trump said there was \"a little problem\" with Apple and recalled a conversation with Cook in which he said he told the CEO, \"I don't want you building in India.\" India has incurred Trump's wrath, as the president signed an order Wednesday to put an additional 25% tariff on the world's most populous country for its use of Russian oil. The new import taxes to be imposed in 21 days could put the combined tariffs on Indian goods at 50%. As part of the Apple announcement, the investments will be about bringing more of its supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S. Apple's new pledge comes just a few weeks after it forged a $500 million deal with MP Materials, which runs the only rare earths producer in the country. That agreement will enable MP Materials to expand a factory in Texas to use recycled materials to produce magnets that make iPhones vibrate. Speaking on a recent investors call, Cook emphasized that \"there's a load of different things done in the United States.\" As examples, he cited some of the iPhone components made in the U.S. such as the device's glass display and module for identifying people's faces and then indicated the company was gearing to expand its productions of other components in its home country. \"We're doing more in this country, and that's on top of having roughly 19 billion chips coming out of the US now, and we will do more,\" Cook told analysts last week, without elaborating. Apple Inc., which is based in Cupertino, California, didn't immediately comment Wednesday. News of Apple's latest investment in the U.S. caused the company's stock price to surge by nearly 6% in Wednesday's midday trading. That gains reflect investors' relief that Cook \"is extending an olive branch\" to the Trump administration, said Nancy Tengler, CEO of money manager Laffer Tengler Investments, which owns Apple stock. Despite Wednesday's upturn, Apple's shares are still down by 14% this year, a reversal of fortune that has also been driven by the company's botched start in the pivotal field of artificial intelligence. Bloomberg News first reported the announcement of Apple's additional investment commitment.\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms; Product_Launch = availability; M&A = deal completion/announcement; etc.)"},"trigger":{"type":"string","description":"How the news surfaced","enum":["press_release","earnings_call","filing","analyst_report","media_report","rumor","social","other"]},"entities":{"type":"array","description":"Companies or organizations involved","items":{"type":"string"}},"scope":{"type":"string","description":"Impacted scope","enum":["company","industry"]},"orientation":{"type":"string","description":"Perspective","enum":["predictive","reflective","both","neutral"]},"time_horizon_days":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"description":"Overall relevance window of this event in days"},"tags":{"type":"array","description":"Reusable tags (e.g., company, product name, quoted people, themes like 'supply chain', 'innovation')","items":{"type":"string"}},"quoted_people":{"type":"array","description":"Individuals quoted in the article (separate from authors)","items":{"type":"string"}},"event_description":{"type":"string","description":"Optional natural-language summary of the top-level event"},"causal_chain":{"type":"array","description":"Sequence of causal steps; step=0 is the triggering event.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

proper planning\")\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal urgency (\"long-term consideration\")\n• **0.0**: No urgency (\"vague future relevance\")\n\n### Amplification Metrics\n\n#### Attention Amplification (0–1)\nHow much coverage, social spread, and media amplification is occurring.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Viral/trending (social media explosion, front-page news)\n• **0.7–0.8**: High amplification (multiple major outlets, significant sharing)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate coverage (industry media, some social traction)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited coverage (niche outlets, minimal sharing)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal amplification (single source, little pickup)\n• **0.0**: No amplification (buried news, no social traction)\n\n### Emotional Profile (Array)\nSelect applicable emotions detected in the narrative. Multiple simultaneous emotions are common.\n\n**Core Emotions**: anticipation, excitement, optimism, confidence, relief, satisfaction, interest, surprise, uncertainty, concern, skepticism, disappointment, fear, anger, disgust, indifference\n\n**Market-Specific Emotions**: FOMO (fear of missing out), greed, euphoria, panic, dread, complacency\n\n**Examples**:\n• Accessory launch = [\"indifference\"]\n• AI breakthrough = [\"excitement\", \"anticipation\", \"FOMO\"]\n• Supply chain disruption = [\"concern\", \"uncertainty\"]\n• Competitive threat = [\"fear\", \"skepticism\"]\n\n### Cognitive Biases (Array)\nList identifiable psychological biases influencing interpretation. Select applicable biases from this list:\n\n**Available Biases**: availability_heuristic, anchoring_bias, confirmation_bias, optimism_bias, overconfidence_bias, loss_aversion, sunk_cost_fallacy, hindsight_bias, recency_bias, herding_behavior, authority_bias, halo_effect, planning_fallacy, survivorship_bias, dunning_kruger_effect\n\n**Examples**:\n• Recent similar success → [\"availability_heuristic\", \"optimism_bias\"]\n• Analyst following prior prediction → [\"anchoring_bias\", \"confirmation_bias\"]\n• Celebrity CEO involvement → [\"authority_bias\", \"halo_effect\"]\n\n## Dual-Layer Belief Analysis\n\n**CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT**: For each causal step, analyze both market perception AND analytical assessment. Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

**unknown**: Market regime signals present but unclear/conflicting\n• **null**: No market regime context determinable from article\n\n### Regime Sensitivity Factors\nFor each step in causal chains, assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n•

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Trump will highlight Apple's plans to invest $100 billion more in US, raising total to $600 billion\nSource: Daily Herald\nPublished: 2025-08-06T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.dailyherald.com/20250806/technology/trump-will-highlight-apples-plans-to-invest-100-billion-more-in-us-raising-total-to-600-billion/\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday is expected to celebrate at the White House a commitment by Apple to increase its U.S. investments by an additional $100 billion over the next four years. \"Today's announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America's economic and national security,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. Apple had previously said it intended to invest $500 billion domestically, a figure it will now increase to $600 billion. Trump in recent months has criticized the tech company and its CEO, Tim Cook, for efforts to shift iPhone production to India to avoid the tariffs his Republican administration had planned for China. While in Qatar earlier this year, Trump said there was \"a little problem\" with Apple and recalled a conversation with Cook in which he said he told the CEO, \"I don't want you building in India.\" India has incurred Trump's wrath, as the president signed an order Wednesday to put an additional 25% tariff on the world's most populous country for its use of Russian oil. The new import taxes to be imposed in 21 days could put the combined tariffs on Indian goods at 50%. As part of the Apple announcement, the investments will be about bringing more of its supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S. Apple's new pledge comes just a few weeks after it forged a $500 million deal with MP Materials, which runs the only rare earths producer in the country. That agreement will enable MP Materials to expand a factory in Texas to use recycled materials to produce magnets that make iPhones vibrate. Speaking on a recent investors call, Cook emphasized that \"there's a load of different things done in the United States.\" As examples, he cited some of the iPhone components made in the U.S. such as the device's glass display and module for identifying people's faces and then indicated the company was gearing to expand its productions of other components in its home country. \"We're doing more in this country, and that's on top of having roughly 19 billion chips coming out of the US now, and we will do more,\" Cook told analysts last week, without elaborating. Apple Inc., which is based in Cupertino, California, didn't immediately comment Wednesday. News of Apple's latest investment in the U.S. caused the company's stock price to surge by nearly 6% in Wednesday's midday trading. That gains reflect investors' relief that Cook \"is extending an olive branch\" to the Trump administration, said Nancy Tengler, CEO of money manager Laffer Tengler Investments, which owns Apple stock. Despite Wednesday's upturn, Apple's shares are still down by 14% this year, a reversal of fortune that has also been driven by the company's botched start in the pivotal field of artificial intelligence. Bloomberg News first reported the announcement of Apple's additional investment commitment.\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms; Product_Launch = availability; M&A = deal completion/announcement; etc.)"},"trigger":{"type":"string","description":"How the news surfaced","enum":["press_release","earnings_call","filing","analyst_report","media_report","rumor","social","other"]},"entities":{"type":"array","description":"Companies or organizations involved","items":{"type":"string"}},"scope":{"type":"string","description":"Impacted scope","enum":["company","industry"]},"orientation":{"type":"string","description":"Perspective","enum":["predictive","reflective","both","neutral"]},"time_horizon_days":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"description":"Overall relevance window of this event in days"},"tags":{"type":"array","description":"Reusable tags (e.g., company, product name, quoted people, themes like 'supply chain', 'innovation')","items":{"type":"string"}},"quoted_people":{"type":"array","description":"Individuals quoted in the article (separate from authors)","items":{"type":"string"}},"event_description":{"type":"string","description":"Optional natural-language summary of the top-level event"},"causal_chain":{"type":"array","description":"Sequence of causal steps; step=0 is the triggering event.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current narrative)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Regime-neutral (independent of market context)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Slightly counter-regime (mild contradiction to sentiment)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Moderately counter-regime (challenges current narrative)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Strongly counter-regime (good news in bear market, bad news in bull market)\n\n#### Reframing Potential (0–1)\nHow easily can this event be reframed to fit dominant narrative.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly reframable (ambiguous interpretation, easily spun either way)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderately reframable (some spin possible with context)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Somewhat reframable (limited interpretation flexibility)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited reframing options (fairly clear implications)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Hard facts (difficult to

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n• **0.26–0.50** = Business model transformation\n• **0.51–1.00** = Company reinvention (reserved for cars, healthcare, AI breakthroughs)\n\n### Calibration Examples:\n• **iPhone 15 launch**: 0.02-0.03 (incremental refresh)\n• **Apple Watch launch**: 0.05-0.08 (new category)\n• **Services push**: 0.08-0.12 (business model shift)\n• **Vision Pro**: 0.03-0.06 (early-stage new category)\n• **Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

2025-08-06T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250807000451315\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON, Aug. 6 (Yonhap) -- U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that his administration will impose a tariff of about 100 percent on semiconductors, a move bound to impact South Korea's chip industry. Trump made the remarks during a White House event where he announced Apple Inc.'s large-scale investment plan, as South Korean tech firms, Samsung Electronics Co. and SK hynix Inc., have been carefully watching his tariff policy developments. \"We'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100 percent on chips and semiconductors,\" he said. Trump reiterated that if a company produces chips in the U.S., there will be \"no charge.\" \"So, (a) 100 percent tariff on all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States,\" he said. \"But if you've made a commitment to build, or if you're in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff.\" He did not elaborate on when the new tariff will go into effect, but during a CNBC interview Tuesday, he touched on a plan to announce sector-specific tariffs \"within the next week or so.\" To impose the tariffs, Trump has invoked Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a law that provides the president with the authority to adjust imports into the U.S. when he determines they threaten to impair national security.\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms;

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

to months)\n• **0.0**: Fleeting (daily news cycle, minimal lasting effect)\n\n#### Urgency (0–1)\nHow immediately people think action or attention is required.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate action required (\"must respond today\")\n• **0.7–0.8**: High urgency (\"needs prompt attention\")\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate urgency (\"should address soon\")\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low urgency (\"can wait for proper planning\")\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal urgency (\"long-term consideration\")\n• **0.0**: No urgency (\"vague future relevance\")\n\n### Amplification Metrics\n\n#### Attention Amplification (0–1)\nHow much coverage, social spread, and media amplification is occurring.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Viral/trending (social media explosion, front-page news)\n• **0.7–0.8**: High amplification (multiple major outlets, significant sharing)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate coverage (industry media, some social traction)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited coverage (niche outlets, minimal sharing)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal amplification (single source, little pickup)\n• **0.0**: No amplification (buried news, no social traction)\n\n### Emotional Profile (Array)\nSelect applicable emotions detected in the narrative. Multiple simultaneous emotions are common.\n\n**Core Emotions**: anticipation, excitement, optimism, confidence, relief, satisfaction, interest, surprise, uncertainty, concern, skepticism, disappointment, fear, anger, disgust, indifference\n\n**Market-Specific Emotions**: FOMO (fear of missing out), greed, euphoria, panic, dread, complacency\n\n**Examples**:\n• Accessory launch = [\"indifference\"]\n• AI breakthrough = [\"excitement\", \"anticipation\", \"FOMO\"]\n• Supply chain disruption = [\"concern\", \"uncertainty\"]\n• Competitive threat = [\"fear\", \"skepticism\"]\n\n### Cognitive Biases (Array)\nList identifiable psychological biases influencing interpretation. Select applicable biases from this list:\n\n**Available Biases**: availability_heuristic, anchoring_bias, confirmation_bias, optimism_bias, overconfidence_bias, loss_aversion, sunk_cost_fallacy, hindsight_bias, recency_bias, herding_behavior, authority_bias, halo_effect, planning_fallacy, survivorship_bias, dunning_kruger_effect\n\n**Examples**:\n• Recent similar success → [\"availability_heuristic\", \"optimism_bias\"]\n• Analyst following prior prediction → [\"anchoring_bias\", \"confirmation_bias\"]\n• Celebrity CEO involvement → [\"authority_bias\", \"halo_effect\"]\n\n## Dual-Layer Belief Analysis\n\n**CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT**: For each causal step, analyze both market perception AND analytical assessment. Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

**unknown**: Market regime signals present but unclear/conflicting\n• **null**: No market regime context determinable from article\n\n### Regime Sensitivity Factors\nFor each step in causal chains, assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n•

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: (2nd LD) Trump says U.S. will put tariff of about 100 percent on semiconductors | Yonhap News Agency\nSource: Yonhap News Agency\nPublished: 2025-08-06T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20250807000452315\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON, Aug. 6 (Yonhap) -- U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that his administration will impose a tariff of about 100 percent on semiconductors, a move bound to impact South Korea's chip industry. Trump made the remarks during a White House event where he announced Apple Inc.'s large-scale investment plan, as South Korean tech firms, Samsung Electronics Co. and SK hynix Inc., have been carefully watching his tariff policy developments. \"We'll be putting a tariff of approximately 100 percent on chips and semiconductors,\" he said. Trump reiterated that if a company produces chips in the U.S., there will be \"no charge.\" \"So, (a) 100 percent tariff on all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States,\" he said. \"But if you've made a commitment to build, or if you're in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff.\" He did not elaborate on when the new tariff will go into effect, but during a CNBC interview Tuesday, he touched on a plan to announce sector-specific tariffs \"within the next week or so.\" To impose the tariffs, Trump has invoked Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, a law that provides the president with the authority to adjust imports into the U.S. when he determines they threaten to impair national security. During the White House event, Trump, alongside Apple CEO Tim Cook, unveiled the iPhone maker's commitment to invest an additional US$100 billion in the U.S., in addition to an earlier investment announcement of $500 billion. Commenting on the investment plan, Trump briefly mentioned Samsung. \"These investments will directly create more than 20,000 brand-new American jobs, and many thousands more at the Apple suppliers like Corning, Broadcom, Texas Instruments and Samsung, who all deal in that world as part of this historic commitment,\" the president said. In related news, Apple said on the day that it is partnering with Samsung at the latter's production facility in Austin, Texas, to launch an \"innovative new technology\" for making chips, which it said has never been used before anywhere in the world.\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms;

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this

Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Trump to announce Apple's plans to invest $100B more in US, raising total to $600B\nSource: ABC7\nPublished: 2025-08-06T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://abc7.com/post/trump-will-highlight-apples-plans-invest-100-billion-more-us-raising-total-600/17453133/\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Wednesday is expected to celebrate at the White House a commitment by Apple to increase its U.S. investments by an additional $100 billion over the next four years. \"Today's announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America's economic and national security,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said. Apple had previously said it intended to invest $500 billion domestically, a figure it will now increase to $600 billion. Trump in recent months has criticized the tech company and its CEO, Tim Cook, for efforts to shift iPhone production to India to avoid the tariffs his Republican administration had planned for China. RELATED: Apple, facing tariffs on Chinese imports, says it will invest $500 billion in US facilities While in Qatar earlier this year, Trump said there was \"a little problem\" with Apple and recalled a conversation with Cook in which he said he told the CEO, \"I don't want you building in India.\" India has incurred Trump's wrath, as the president signed an order Wednesday to put an additional 25% tariff on the world's most populous country for its use of Russian oil. The new import taxes to be imposed in 21 days could put the combined tariffs on Indian goods at 50%. As part of the Apple announcement, the investments will be about bringing more of its supply chain and advanced manufacturing to the U.S. Apple's new pledge comes just a few weeks after it forged a $500 million deal with MP Materials, which runs the only rare earths producer in the country. That agreement will enable MP Materials to expand a factory in Texas to use recycled materials to produce magnets that make iPhones vibrate. Speaking on a recent investors call, Cook emphasized that \"there's a load of different things done in the United States.\" As examples, he cited some of the iPhone components made in the U.S. such as the device's glass display and module for identifying people's faces and then indicated the company was gearing to expand its productions of other components in its home country. \"We're doing more in this country, and that's on top of having roughly 19 billion chips coming out of the US now, and we will do more,\" Cook told analysts last week, without elaborating. Apple Inc., which is based in Cupertino, California, didn't immediately comment Wednesday. News of Apple's latest investment in the U.S. caused the company's stock price to surge by nearly 6% in Wednesday's midday trading. That gains reflect investors' relief that Cook \"is extending an olive branch\" to the Trump administration, said Nancy Tengler, CEO of money manager Laffer Tengler Investments, which owns Apple stock. Despite Wednesday's upturn, Apple's shares are still down by 14% this year, a reversal of fortune that has also been driven by the company's botched start in the pivotal field of artificial intelligence. Bloomberg News first reported the announcement of Apple's additional investment commitment.\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms; Product_Launch = availability; M&A = deal completion/announcement; etc.)"},"trigger":{"type":"string","description":"How the news surfaced","enum":["press_release","earnings_call","filing","analyst_report","media_report","rumor","social","other"]},"entities":{"type":"array","description":"Companies or organizations involved","items":{"type":"string"}},"scope":{"type":"string","description":"Impacted scope","enum":["company","industry"]},"orientation":{"type":"string","description":"Perspective","enum":["predictive","reflective","both","neutral"]},"time_horizon_days":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"description":"Overall relevance window of this event in days"},"tags":{"type":"array","description":"Reusable tags (e.g., company, product name, quoted people, themes like 'supply chain', 'innovation')","items":{"type":"string"}},"quoted_people":{"type":"array","description":"Individuals quoted in the article (separate from authors)","items":{"type":"string"}},"event_description":{"type":"string","description":"Optional natural-language summary of the top-level event"},"causal_chain":{"type":"array","description":"Sequence of causal steps; step=0 is the triggering event.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

**0.9–1.0**: Official sources (SEC filings, earnings calls, press releases)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Credible reporting (established journalists, verified sources)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Industry speculation (analyst reports, informed estimates)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Rumors with credibility (supply chain leaks, insider reports)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Pure speculation (unverified claims, social media rumors)\n• **0.0**: Known false (contradicted by official sources)\n\n#### Certainty – Impact (0–1)\nConfidence that the event will meaningfully affect Apple's value.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Direct fundamental impact (earnings guidance, major product launch)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong business connection (key partnership, regulatory change)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate relevance (competitive moves, industry trends)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Indirect influence (supply chain issues, market sentiment)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Weak connection (tangential news, minor announcements)\n• **0.0**: No material impact (irrelevant or offsetting factors)\n\n### Emotional Dimensions\n\n#### Hope vs Fear (-1 → +1)\nEmotional valence about future outcomes.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme optimism (\"Apple could dominate this space\")\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Strong hope (\"this looks very promising\")\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild optimism (\"generally positive development\")\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Neutral sentiment (balanced or factual reporting)\n•

**-0.1 to +0.1**: Balanced complexity (neither simple nor complex)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Somewhat complex (\"multiple variables\")\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Quite complex (\"many unknowns\")\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extremely complex (\"too many variables to predict\")\n\n#### Risk Appetite (0–1)\nWillingness to accept uncertainty and potential downsides.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High risk tolerance (embracing bold moves, accepting volatility)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderate risk acceptance (calculated risks, measured optimism)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Balanced approach (weighing pros and cons equally)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Risk-averse (preferring proven approaches, cautious outlook)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Very conservative (avoiding uncertainty, safety-first mentality)\n• **0.0**: Risk-avoidant (rejecting any uncertainty or downside potential)\n\n### Temporal Factors\n\n#### Duration Expectation (0–1)\nPerceived longevity of the issue or its effects.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Permanent/structural (fundamental business model shifts)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Long-term (multi-year implications)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Medium-term (1-2 year effects)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Short-term (quarterly to annual impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Brief impact (weeks to months)\n• **0.0**: Fleeting (daily news cycle, minimal lasting effect)\n\n#### Urgency (0–1)\nHow immediately people think action or attention is required.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate action required (\"must respond today\")\n• **0.7–0.8**: High urgency (\"needs prompt attention\")\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate urgency (\"should address soon\")\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low urgency (\"can wait for proper planning\")\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal urgency (\"long-term consideration\")\n• **0.0**: No urgency (\"vague future relevance\")\n\n### Amplification Metrics\n\n#### Attention Amplification (0–1)\nHow much coverage, social spread, and media amplification is occurring.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Viral/trending (social media explosion, front-page news)\n• **0.7–0.8**: High amplification (multiple major outlets, significant sharing)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate coverage (industry media, some social traction)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited coverage (niche outlets, minimal sharing)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal amplification (single source, little pickup)\n• **0.0**: No amplification (buried news, no social traction)\n\n### Emotional Profile (Array)\nSelect applicable emotions detected in the narrative. Multiple simultaneous emotions are common.\n\n**Core Emotions**: anticipation, excitement, optimism, confidence, relief, satisfaction, interest, surprise, uncertainty, concern, skepticism, disappointment, fear, anger, disgust, indifference\n\n**Market-Specific Emotions**: FOMO (fear of missing out), greed, euphoria, panic, dread, complacency\n\n**Examples**:\n• Accessory launch = [\"indifference\"]\n• AI breakthrough = [\"excitement\", \"anticipation\", \"FOMO\"]\n• Supply chain disruption = [\"concern\", \"uncertainty\"]\n• Competitive threat = [\"fear\", \"skepticism\"]\n\n### Cognitive Biases (Array)\nList identifiable psychological biases influencing interpretation.

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n•

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Apple to pledge $100 billion for US manufacturing, White House official says\nSource: One America News Network\nPublished: 2025-08-06T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.oann.com/tech/apple-to-pledge-100-billion-for-us-manufacturing-white-house-official-says/\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will announce a domestic manufacturing pledge of $100 billion on Wednesday that will focus on bringing more manufacturing to the United States, a White House official said. The pledge would be a new financial commitment, the official said on the customary condition of anonymity. It comes as President Donald Trump pursues an aggressive tariff and trade agenda aimed at moving some manufacturing back into the United States. Apple said in February it would spend $500 billion in U.S. investments in the next four years that will include a giant factory in Texas for artificial intelligence servers while adding about 20,000 research and development jobs across the country. Apple (AAPL.O) did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Trump's tariffs cost Apple $800 million in the June quarter and spurred some customers to buy iPhones in late spring this year. Apple has been shifting production of products bound for the U.S., sourcing iPhones from India and other products such as Macs and Apple Watches from Vietnam. The ultimate tariff rates many Apple products could face remain in flux, and many of its products are currently exempt. \"Today's announcement with Apple is another win for our manufacturing industry that will simultaneously help reshore the production of critical components to protect America's economic and national security,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement. The previously announced $500 billion in expected spending from Apple includes everything from purchases from U.S. suppliers to U.S. filming of television shows and movies for its Apple TV+ service. Nancy Tengler, CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments, which holds Apple shares, said the announcement would be a \"savvy solution to the president's demand that Apple manufacture all iPhones in the U.S. \"The stock is up on the news, likely a relief rally that (Apple CEO Tim) Cook, who has been largely mute in response to the attacks on the company, is extending an olive branch.\" Earlier, White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett told Fox Business Network that Apple was likely to make an investment announcement on Wednesday, as he discussed the financial pledges made by companies and countries under Trump.\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms;

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild

to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Iranians targeted with spyware in lead-up to war with Israel: Research\nSource: The Straits Times\nPublished: 2025-07-22T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/iranians-targeted-with-spyware-in-lead-up-to-war-with-israel-research\n\nBody:\nTEXAS - More than a dozen Iranians' mobile phones were targeted with spyware in the months prior to the country's war with Israel, according to new research. Miaan Group, a digital human rights organisation based in Austin, Texas, found a number of Iranians who received threat notifications from Apple Inc. in the first half of 2025, and researchers believe they only identified a fraction of the total targets. Another round of Iranian spyware targets was discovered by Mr Hamid Kashfi, a Sweden-based cybersecurity researcher and founder of the firm DarkCell. The attacks mark the first known example of such highly advanced cyber-espionage tools being used both inside Iran and against Iranians living abroad. It's not clear who was behind the attacks. Miaan Group said the victims included two Iranian dissidents inside the country and a technology worker who is an Iranian citizen living in Europe, who were targeted with spyware on their iPhones. They were first notified of the incident via text message by Apple, which typically sends a threat notification message to victims when a hack is detected. Mr Kashfi said he found 12 victims, all inside Iran and working either in the country's technology sector or for the government. Both Mr Kashfi and the Miaan Group declined to name the victims in order to protect their safety. The threat notifications, which were seen by Bloomberg, describe the attacks as \"exceptionally rare\" and costing \"millions of dollars\". The Apple notification, which is careful to note that the company doesn't attribute the attacks, compared the sophistication and cost of the recent attacks to Pegasus spyware from NSO Group. \"The extreme cost, sophistication and worldwide nature makes mercenary spyware attacks some of the most advanced digital threads in existence today,\" Apple told the Iranian targets. \"This attack is likely targeting you specifically because of who you are or what you do.\" Apple didn't respond to a Bloomberg request for comment. The notification added that \"Apple has high confidence in this warning.\" Mr Kashfi said his investigation concluded that \"zero-day zero-click\" attacks were likely used. That approach exploits hidden vulnerabilities and require no interaction from the victim. \"Zero-click chains are more sophisticated, more expensive, one stage higher than typical hacking campaigns,\" Mr Kashfi said. \"But they weren't shy about using it and burning it.\" Neither Mr Kashfi nor the Miaan Group were able to do full forensic examinations of the targeted iPhones. In several cases, being inside Iran made examinations impossible. In others, victims only came forward months after the notification. Finally, other targets chose to take their targeted iPhones to be examined by the Iranian government security services rather than independent experts living abroad, Mr Kashfi said.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n####

effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild

(conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n• **0.26–0.50** = Business model transformation\n• **0.51–1.00** = Company reinvention (reserved for cars, healthcare, AI breakthroughs)\n\n### Calibration Examples:\n• **iPhone 15 launch**: 0.02-0.03 (incremental refresh)\n• **Apple Watch launch**: 0.05-0.08 (new category)\n• **Services push**: 0.08-0.12 (business model shift)\n• **Vision Pro**: 0.03-0.06 (early-stage new category)\n• **Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Trump aims tariff double whammy at industries, nations by Aug. 1\nSource: ArcaMax\nPublished: 2025-07-18T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.arcamax.com/currentnews/newsheadlines/s-3781899\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is readying plans for industry-specific tariffs to kick in alongside his country-by-country duties in two weeks, ramping up his push to reshape the United States' standing in the global trading system by penalizing purchases from abroad. Administration officials could release details of Trump's planned 50% duty on copper in the days before they're set to take effect Aug. 1, according to a person familiar with the matter. That's the same date so-called reciprocal levies on products from more than a 100 nations are slated to begin. Trump said Tuesday he is likely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals by month's end, adding that import taxes on semiconductors could come soon as well. One person familiar with the process said after copper, Trump's team has discussed making announcements on lumber, chips, critical minerals and drugs in that order, though that cadence has not been finalized and may change. Those would follow existing duties on steel, aluminum, automobiles and car parts. Once fully implemented, all the sectoral tariffs would cover 30% to 70% of a country's imports, with much of the rest being hit by country-specific charges, according to a person familiar with the matter. The coming wave of U.S. customs taxes will test the calm in financial markets, where investors mostly see Trump's tough tariff talk as a negotiating ploy prone to delays and de-escalation rather than a prolonged economic headwind. After investigations that can last about nine months, sectoral duties are being imposed on national security grounds under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. It's seen as stronger legal footing than the emergency powers Trump used for his country levies, which face court challenges and are being assigned in letters to dozens of trading partners without a deal. The European Union, Japan, India and others have sought to lower both their reciprocal and sectoral rates. That's complicating talks, given that U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer handles country-based rates, while Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick oversees tariffs on industries, according to people familiar with the dynamics. Trump told reporters Tuesday that drug duties would come \"probably at the end of the month, and we're going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we're going to make it a very high tariff.\" Last month, he said duties on pharmaceuticals could grow as high as 200%. Lutnick said July 8 that the phase-in period could last up to two years. A staff draft document has focused levies on between 80 and 90 generic essential medicines, as well as specialty chemicals and precursors, according to a person familiar with it. Those parameters have not been set, however, and the complex nature of the investigation could mean the process could drag out longer, another person said. Levies on generic medicines that have slim profit margins could hit companies including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Sandoz Group AG. A broader hit that includes brand-name drugs like Ozempic and Keytruda will weigh on the largest manufacturers, such as Eli Lily & Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer Inc. Semiconductors Chips tariffs are on a \"similar\" timeline to drugs and are \"actually less complicated,\" Trump said Tuesday. Semiconductors were exempted earlier this year from U.S. tariffs on China to give the administration time to develop separate duties. The wide array of exempted products, including inputs for consumer electronics, suggests a very broad consideration of item that could get hit later. Tech companies, auto manufacturers, boat makers and cryptocurrency enthusiasts are among those who have registered complaints over potential levies, according to public comments on the probe, which started in April. The charges won't just hit the chips themselves, but popular products including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. smartphones and laptops. It's even brought together rivals Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and Ford Motor Co., which have all voiced reservations. Copper Copper duties are set to include all refined metal as well as semi-finished products used in power grids, data centers and the military, Bloomberg has reported. The outcome of the investigation that started in March could have an outsize effect on consumer prices, because the metal is in automobiles, homebuilding materials, appliances and many other products. While domestic copper producers competing with foreign suppliers may benefit, U.S. buyers of copper targeted with levies will face higher costs. Some of the nation's largest copper miners met Thursday in Washington to discuss how best to message the administration on how to boost the domestic industry while also avoiding punitive tariffs that would harm production. Lumber The administration's lumber investigation is proceeding on a separate track from existing duties on the material from Canada -- by far the U.S.'s top source of imports. The probe is expected to conclude by summer's end, trade attorney Luke Meisner said during a Wednesday panel. More than a dozen lawmakers have pushed the Commerce Department to implement tariffs of at least 60% on imported wood products, such as cabinets and vanities. Some have urged the administration to tariff cabinets at 100% tariffs. Republicans from Alabama, North Carolina and Pennsylvania have written letters to the administration that their home-state manufacturers are threatened by cheap foreign imports. Senator Tommy Tuberville said he expects the administration to fulfill their requests. Critical Minerals The critical minerals investigation has proved difficult, according to people familiar with the process. The administration has made several moves to speed domestic mineral extraction and processing in order to reduce dependence on China. But in the short term, there is little domestic industry to protect with tariffs. Only one U.S.-based company operates a rare-earth mine and processing operation. America remains reliant on imports and tariffs could create supply crunches. Commercial Aviation The EU is among the economies negotiating with the administration for exemptions from possible tariffs on commercial aircraft and jet engines. The Commerce Department launched its investigation in May, which remains pending. Others The Commerce Department on Monday launched investigations into drones and polysilicon, a key material for solar panels, setting the stage for tariffs but likely at a later date. The department also started an investigation into medium- and heavy-duty trucks used in shipping in April that is ongoing. _____ (With assistance from Jennifer A.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Select applicable biases from this list:\n\n**Available Biases**: availability_heuristic, anchoring_bias, confirmation_bias, optimism_bias, overconfidence_bias, loss_aversion, sunk_cost_fallacy, hindsight_bias, recency_bias, herding_behavior, authority_bias, halo_effect, planning_fallacy, survivorship_bias, dunning_kruger_effect\n\n**Examples**:\n• Recent similar success → [\"availability_heuristic\", \"optimism_bias\"]\n• Analyst following prior prediction → [\"anchoring_bias\", \"confirmation_bias\"]\n• Celebrity CEO involvement → [\"authority_bias\", \"halo_effect\"]\n\n## Dual-Layer Belief Analysis\n\n**CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT**: For each causal step, analyze both market perception AND analytical assessment. Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

markets with general optimism, growth expectations\n• **bear**: Declining markets with pessimism, contraction fears\n• **neutral**: Stable or mixed market conditions, balanced sentiment\n• **unknown**: Market regime signals present but unclear/conflicting\n• **null**: No market regime context determinable from article\n\n### Regime Sensitivity Factors\nFor each step in causal chains, assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current narrative)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Regime-neutral (independent of market context)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Slightly counter-regime (mild contradiction to sentiment)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Moderately counter-regime (challenges current narrative)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Strongly counter-regime (good news in bear market, bad news in bull market)\n\n#### Reframing Potential (0–1)\nHow easily can this event be reframed to fit dominant narrative.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly reframable (ambiguous interpretation, easily spun either way)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderately reframable (some spin possible with

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n•

(incremental refresh)\n• **Apple Watch launch**: 0.05-0.08 (new category)\n• **Services push**: 0.08-0.12 (business model shift)\n• **Vision Pro**: 0.03-0.06 (early-stage new category)\n• **Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Trump says drug tariffs probable by Aug 1, downplays more deals\nSource: The Star \nPublished: 2025-07-16T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2025/07/17/trump-says-drug-tariffs-probable-by-aug-1-downplays-more-deals\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON: President Donald Trump says that he was likely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals as soon as the end of this month. He added that levies on semiconductors could come soon as well, suggesting that those import taxes could hit alongside broad \"reciprocal\" rates set for implementation on Aug 1. \"Probably at the end of the month, and we're going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we're going to make it a very high tariff,\" Trump told reporters on Tuesday as he returned to Washington after attending an artificial intelligence summit in Pittsburgh. Trump also said his timeline for implementing tariffs on semiconductors was \"similar\" and that it was \"less complicated\" to impose levies on chips, without providing additional detail. At a Cabinet meeting earlier this month, Trump said he planned to impose a 50% tariff on copper in the coming weeks, and that he expected pharmaceutical tariffs to grow as high as 200% after giving companies a year to bring manufacturing back to the United States. Trump has already announced investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 on drugs, arguing a flood of foreign imports was threatening national security. Still, any tariffs could immediately impact drugmakers like Eli Lilly & Co., Merck & Co and Pfizer Inc that produce drugs overseas, and risk driving up costs for US consumers. So does Trump's plans for semiconductor tariffs, which are expected to hit not only the chips themselves but popular products like Apple Inc and Samsung Electronic Co Ltd laptops and smartphones. The threat came as Trump in recent days has sent letters to a number of trading partners unilaterally dictating the rates for tariffs on many imports, while maintaining he would continue to carry out negotiations. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump announced an agreement with Indonesia reducing the 32% rate announced in one of the letters to 19%. Indonesia agreed to purchase US$15bil in US energy, US$4.5bil worth of agricultural products and 50 Boeing Co jets as part of the agreement, the United States said. Trump on Tuesday predicted that he could strike \"two or three\" trade deals with countries before implementing his so-called reciprocal tariffs on Aug 1, saying that an agreement with India was among the most likely. Trump told reporters the United States was engaged in substantive discussions with between five and six countries, but that he wasn't necessarily inclined to finalise agreements over simply dictating a tariff rate. \"I would say India, and we have a couple of others, but I have to tell you, for the most part, I'm very happy with the letters,\" Trump said. The President also said that he was likely to impose a standard tariff of \"probably a little over 10%\" on smaller countries that did not receive tailored rates. Earlier on Tuesday, Trump said representatives from the European Union, which faces a 30% tariff, would be meeting with US negotiators this week. After returning from Pittsburgh, Trump said that while some countries had indicated a willingness to \"open\" trade after his threats, including South Korea, others, like Japan, had not. -- Bloomberg\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms; Product_Launch = availability; M&A = deal completion/announcement; etc.)"},"trigger":{"type":"string","description":"How the news surfaced","enum":["press_release","earnings_call","filing","analyst_report","media_report","rumor","social","other"]},"entities":{"type":"array","description":"Companies or organizations involved","items":{"type":"string"}},"scope":{"type":"string","description":"Impacted scope","enum":["company","industry"]},"orientation":{"type":"string","description":"Perspective","enum":["predictive","reflective","both","neutral"]},"time_horizon_days":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"description":"Overall relevance window of this event in days"},"tags":{"type":"array","description":"Reusable tags (e.g., company, product name, quoted people, themes like 'supply chain', 'innovation')","items":{"type":"string"}},"quoted_people":{"type":"array","description":"Individuals quoted in the article (separate from authors)","items":{"type":"string"}},"event_description":{"type":"string","description":"Optional natural-language summary of the top-level event"},"causal_chain":{"type":"array","description":"Sequence of causal steps; step=0 is the triggering event.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does

(conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Trump to impose pharma tariffs by August 1, semiconductors likely next\nSource: Economic Times\nPublished: 2025-07-16T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/global-trends/trump-to-impose-pharma-tariffs-by-august-1-semiconductors-likely-next/articleshow/122589779.cms\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said that he was likely to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals as soon as the end of the month and that levies on semiconductors could come soon as well, suggesting that those import taxes could hit alongside broad \"reciprocal\" rates set for implementation on Aug. 1. \"Probably at the end of the month, and we're going to start off with a low tariff and give the pharmaceutical companies a year or so to build, and then we're going to make it a very high tariff,\" Trump told reporters Tuesday as he returned to Washington after attending an artificial intelligence summit in Pittsburgh. Trump also said his timeline for implementing tariffs on semiconductors was \"similar\" and that it was \"less complicated\" to impose levies on chips, without providing additional detail. At a Cabinet meeting earlier this month, Trump said he planned to impose a 50% tariff on copper in the coming weeks, and that he expected pharmaceutical tariffs to grow as high as 200% after giving companies a year to bring manufacturing back to the US. Trump has already announced investigations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 on drugs, arguing a flood of foreign imports was threatening national security. Still, any tariffs could immediately impact drugmakers like Eli Lilly & Co., Merck & Co. and Pfizer Inc. that produce drugs overseas - and risks driving up costs for US consumers. So does Trump's plans for semiconductor tariffs, which are expected to hit not only the chips themselves but popular products like Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronic Co Ltd. laptops and smartphones.\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms; Product_Launch = availability; M&A = deal completion/announcement; etc.)"},"trigger":{"type":"string","description":"How the news surfaced","enum":["press_release","earnings_call","filing","analyst_report","media_report","rumor","social","other"]},"entities":{"type":"array","description":"Companies or organizations involved","items":{"type":"string"}},"scope":{"type":"string","description":"Impacted scope","enum":["company","industry"]},"orientation":{"type":"string","description":"Perspective","enum":["predictive","reflective","both","neutral"]},"time_horizon_days":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"description":"Overall relevance window of this event in days"},"tags":{"type":"array","description":"Reusable tags (e.g., company, product name, quoted people, themes like 'supply chain', 'innovation')","items":{"type":"string"}},"quoted_people":{"type":"array","description":"Individuals quoted in the article (separate from authors)","items":{"type":"string"}},"event_description":{"type":"string","description":"Optional natural-language summary of the top-level event"},"causal_chain":{"type":"array","description":"Sequence of causal steps; step=0 is the triggering event.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n####

effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild

to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*:

Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current narrative)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Regime-neutral (independent of market context)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Slightly counter-regime (mild contradiction to sentiment)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Moderately counter-regime (challenges current narrative)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Strongly counter-regime (good news in bear market, bad news in bull market)\n\n#### Reframing Potential (0–1)\nHow easily can this event be reframed to fit dominant narrative.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly reframable (ambiguous interpretation, easily spun either way)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderately reframable (some spin possible with context)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Somewhat reframable (limited interpretation flexibility)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited reframing options (fairly clear implications)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Hard facts (difficult to

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n• **0.26–0.50** = Business model transformation\n• **0.51–1.00** = Company reinvention (reserved for cars, healthcare, AI breakthroughs)\n\n### Calibration Examples:\n• **iPhone 15 launch**: 0.02-0.03 (incremental refresh)\n• **Apple Watch launch**: 0.05-0.08 (new category)\n• **Services push**: 0.08-0.12 (business model shift)\n• **Vision Pro**: 0.03-0.06 (early-stage new category)\n• **Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

Contact the DJS Law Group to Discuss Your Rights\nSource: Market Screener\nPublished: 2025-07-14T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/APPLE-INC-4849/news/AAPL-Securities-Lawsuit-Filed-Against-Apple-Inc-Contact-the-DJS-Law-Group-to-Discuss-Your-Rights-50499273/\n\nBody:\nLOS ANGELES, July 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The DJS Law Group reminds investors of a class action lawsuit against Apple Inc. (\"Apple\" or \"the Company\") (NASDAQ: AAPL) for violations of securities laws. Shareholders who purchased the Company's securities between June 10, 2024, and June 9, 2025, inclusive (the \"Class Period\"), are encouraged to contact the firm before August 19, 2025. CASE DETAILS: The Complaint alleges that the Company issued false and misleading statements to the public. Apple provided investors with a false impression regarding the timeline for integrating advanced AI-driven Siri capabilities into its devices. It was improbable that these features would be available for the iPhone 16. The absence of AI functionality negatively impacted iPhone 16 sales. Given these circumstances, the Company's public representations were materially false and misleading throughout the class period. When the truth about Apple was revealed, investors incurred financial losses, contact us to participate. WHY DJS LAW GROUP?

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

required (\"must respond today\")\n• **0.7–0.8**: High urgency (\"needs prompt attention\")\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate urgency (\"should address soon\")\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low urgency (\"can wait for proper planning\")\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal urgency (\"long-term consideration\")\n• **0.0**: No urgency (\"vague future relevance\")\n\n### Amplification Metrics\n\n#### Attention Amplification (0–1)\nHow much coverage, social spread, and media amplification is occurring.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Viral/trending (social media explosion, front-page news)\n• **0.7–0.8**: High amplification (multiple major outlets, significant sharing)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate coverage (industry media, some social traction)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited coverage (niche outlets, minimal sharing)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal amplification (single source, little pickup)\n• **0.0**: No amplification (buried news, no social traction)\n\n### Emotional Profile (Array)\nSelect applicable emotions detected in the narrative. Multiple simultaneous emotions are common.\n\n**Core Emotions**: anticipation, excitement, optimism, confidence, relief, satisfaction, interest, surprise, uncertainty, concern, skepticism, disappointment, fear, anger, disgust, indifference\n\n**Market-Specific Emotions**: FOMO (fear of missing out), greed, euphoria, panic, dread, complacency\n\n**Examples**:\n• Accessory launch = [\"indifference\"]\n• AI breakthrough = [\"excitement\", \"anticipation\", \"FOMO\"]\n• Supply chain disruption = [\"concern\", \"uncertainty\"]\n• Competitive threat = [\"fear\", \"skepticism\"]\n\n### Cognitive Biases (Array)\nList identifiable psychological biases influencing interpretation. Select applicable biases from this list:\n\n**Available Biases**: availability_heuristic, anchoring_bias, confirmation_bias, optimism_bias, overconfidence_bias, loss_aversion, sunk_cost_fallacy, hindsight_bias, recency_bias, herding_behavior, authority_bias, halo_effect, planning_fallacy, survivorship_bias, dunning_kruger_effect\n\n**Examples**:\n• Recent similar success → [\"availability_heuristic\", \"optimism_bias\"]\n• Analyst following prior prediction → [\"anchoring_bias\", \"confirmation_bias\"]\n• Celebrity CEO involvement → [\"authority_bias\", \"halo_effect\"]\n\n## Dual-Layer Belief Analysis\n\n**CRITICAL ENHANCEMENT**: For each causal step, analyze both market perception AND analytical assessment. Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

**unknown**: Market regime signals present but unclear/conflicting\n• **null**: No market regime context determinable from article\n\n### Regime Sensitivity Factors\nFor each step in causal chains, assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n•

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all investors who purchased or acquired Apple, Inc. AAPL securities between June 10, 2024 and June 9, 2025. Apple is a multinational technology company that engages primarily in the business of smart-device and computer design and manufacturing, entertainment and artificial intelligence (\"AI\"). For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations That Apple, Inc. (AAPL) Misled Investors Regarding the Availability of Updates to its AI-Based Siri Feature According to the complaint, in June 2024, Apple announced advanced AI-based Siri features as the primary reason for customers to purchase the iPhone 16. Plaintiff contends, however, that during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (i) Apple misstated the time it would take to integrate the advanced AI-based Siri features into its devices; (ii) accordingly, it was highly unlikely that these features would be available for the iPhone 16; (iii) the lack of such advanced AI-based features would hurt iPhone 16 sales; and (iv) as a result, Apple's business and/or financial prospects were overstated. When the truth was revealed, Apple's stock price fell, harming investors. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Apple, Inc.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

AAPL securities between June 10, 2024 and June 9, 2025. Apple is a multinational technology company that engages primarily in the business of smart-device and computer design and manufacturing, entertainment and artificial intelligence (\"AI\"). For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations That Apple, Inc. (AAPL) Misled Investors Regarding the Availability of Updates to its AI-Based Siri Feature According to the complaint, in June 2024, Apple announced advanced AI-based Siri features as the primary reason for customers to purchase the iPhone 16. Plaintiff contends, however, that during the class period, defendants failed to disclose that: (i) Apple misstated the time it would take to integrate the advanced AI-based Siri features into its devices; (ii) accordingly, it was highly unlikely that these features would be available for the iPhone 16; (iii) the lack of such advanced AI-based features would hurt iPhone 16 sales; and (iv) as a result, Apple's business and/or financial prospects were overstated. When the truth was revealed, Apple's stock price fell, harming investors. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against Apple, Inc.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

markets with general optimism, growth expectations\n• **bear**: Declining markets with pessimism, contraction fears\n• **neutral**: Stable or mixed market conditions, balanced sentiment\n• **unknown**: Market regime signals present but unclear/conflicting\n• **null**: No market regime context determinable from article\n\n### Regime Sensitivity Factors\nFor each step in causal chains, assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current narrative)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Regime-neutral (independent of market context)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Slightly counter-regime (mild contradiction to sentiment)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Moderately counter-regime (challenges current narrative)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Strongly counter-regime (good news in bear market, bad news in bull market)\n\n#### Reframing Potential (0–1)\nHow easily can this event be reframed to fit dominant narrative.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly reframable (ambiguous interpretation, easily spun either way)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderately reframable (some spin possible with

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n•

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: S&P 500 climbs at end of best quarter since 2023\nSource: The Star \nPublished: 2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2025/07/02/sp-500-climbs-at-end-of-best-quarter-since-2023\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON: Wall Street's bulls are driving stocks to all-time highs at the end of a solid quarter amid hopes the United States is moving closer to reaching concrete deals with its top trading partners. Bets the Federal Reserve (Fed) will resume rate cuts powered the best first-half stretch for Treasuries in five years. The dollar saw its longest monthly slide since 2017. Following a roughly 25% surge from its April lows, the S&P 500 notched its best quarter since December 2023. The US equity benchmark topped the 6,200 milestone on Monday, with technology shares leading the charge. Apple Inc climbed the most among megacaps. Oracle Corp jumped on a cloud-services deal worth US$30bil a year. Big banks gained after passing the Fed's annual stress test, setting the stage for payouts. \"Markets proved remarkably adaptable and resilient in the face of geopolitical shocks and trade uncertainty in the first half, largely because economic and profit conditions stood on firm footing,\" said Anthony Saglimbene at Ameriprise. Just days ahead of the jobs report, bonds rose. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent indicated it wouldn't make sense to ramp up sales of longer-term debt given where yields are, though he held out hope that rates across maturities will drop as inflation slows. Goldman Sachs Group Inc projects a Fed cut in September as the inflationary effects of tariffs \"look a bit smaller\" than expected. A relative sense of calm prevailed at the end of a first half that saw wild swings lashing markets across the board amid President Donald Trump's fast-evolving trade war, world conflicts, and recession jitters, as well as concerns about a ballooning deficit that could threaten America's status as a safe haven. \"No one could fault an investor if at one point during the first half of 2025 they shouted, 'Stop the world, I want to get off',\" said Sam Stovall at CFRA. With Trump's July 9 trade deadline fast approaching, the European Union is willing to accept an accord that includes a 10% universal tariff on many of the bloc's exports but seeks key exemptions. Trump threatened to impose a fresh tariff level on Japan, while his top economic adviser said the White House aims to finalise deals with partners after the July 4 holiday. \"The biggest catalyst for financial markets as a whole could be progress in trade talks - or a lack thereof,\" said Fawad Razaqzada at City Index and Forex.com. \"As long as there are no major escalations again in the Middle East or in the trade war, you'd think stock markets may not suffer much on any macro data. \"Still, there is always room for surprises.\" To Ulrike Hoffmann-Burchardi at UBS Global Wealth Management, while tariff headlines could periodically unsettle markets, they shouldn't be a catalyst for a sustained market selloff. \"For investors under-allocated to broad equity markets, we recommend gradually increasing exposure to diversified global stocks or balanced portfolios to position for stronger potential returns in 2026 and beyond,\" she said. At JPMorgan Chase & Co, strategists led by Mislav Matejka said US stocks could come under pressure if Fed rate cuts are accompanied by weaker economic growth. As long as there isn't a meaningful rise in the unemployment rate, American equities are likely to get a boost from Fed policy easing, said Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson. \"The market has shrugged off signs of a slowing economy, but with the tariff picture still up in the air, a negative surprise on the jobs front could have more of an impact, especially during what will likely be a light-volume holiday week,\" said Chris Larkin from Morgan Stanley. The June employment report, due tomorrow given the July 4 holiday on Friday, is forecast to show growth in the workforce easing to about 110,000 new jobs from 139,000 the prior month, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The unemployment rate is seen nudging up to 4.3%. For a Fed awaiting more clarity on the potential inflationary impact from tariffs, any pronounced deterioration in the labour market would likely lead to more pressure on officials to lower rates. Last Friday, Bank of America Corp strategists warned of the increasing risk of a speculative stock-market bubble as traders drive massive flows into equities on expectations of rate cuts. -- Bloomberg\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms; Product_Launch = availability; M&A = deal completion/announcement; etc.)"},"trigger":{"type":"string","description":"How the news surfaced","enum":["press_release","earnings_call","filing","analyst_report","media_report","rumor","social","other"]},"entities":{"type":"array","description":"Companies or organizations involved","items":{"type":"string"}},"scope":{"type":"string","description":"Impacted scope","enum":["company","industry"]},"orientation":{"type":"string","description":"Perspective","enum":["predictive","reflective","both","neutral"]},"time_horizon_days":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"description":"Overall relevance window of this event in days"},"tags":{"type":"array","description":"Reusable tags (e.g., company, product name, quoted people, themes like 'supply chain', 'innovation')","items":{"type":"string"}},"quoted_people":{"type":"array","description":"Individuals quoted in the article (separate from authors)","items":{"type":"string"}},"event_description":{"type":"string","description":"Optional natural-language summary of the top-level event"},"causal_chain":{"type":"array","description":"Sequence of causal steps; step=0 is the triggering event.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this

Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: US judge allows antitrust lawsuit against Apple to proceed | Mint\nSource: mint\nPublished: 2025-06-30T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.livemint.com/focus/us-judge-allows-antitrust-lawsuit-against-apple-to-proceed-11751321925215.html\n\nBody:\nNew Jersey, Jun 30 (AP) A federal judge on Monday rebuffed Apple's request to throw out a US government lawsuit alleging the technology trendsetter has built a maze of illegal barriers to protect the iPhone from competition and fatten its profit margins. The 33-page opinion from US District Judge Xavier Neals in New Jersey will enable an antitrust lawsuit that the US Justice Department filed against Apple 15 months ago to proceed. Neals has set a timetable that could see the case come to trial in 2027. Apple has sought to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing the Justice Department had distorted the contours of the smartphone market and made a series of other misinterpretations that warranted the case be thrown out. But Neals decided there is enough evidence to support the Justice Department's market definitions and concluded the case's key allegations merited further examination at trial. The case seeks to pierce the digital fortress that Apple Inc, based in Cupertino, California, has built around the iPhone, iPad and other products to create a so-called \"walled garden\" allowing its hardware and software to mesh seamlessly for users. The Justice Department alleges that walled garden has mostly turned into a shield against competition, creating market conditions that enable it to charge higher prices and stifle innovation. The lawsuit \"sets forth several allegations of technological barricades that constitute anticompetitive conduct,\" Neals wrote in his opinion. The judge also concluded the Justice Department had pointed toward enough areas of troubling conduct that raised the \"dangerous possibility\" that Apple has turned the iPhone into an illegal monopoly. In a Monday statement, Apple reiterated its position that the Justice Department's case \"is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will continue to vigorously fight it in court\". The antitrust lawsuit isn't the only legal headache threatening to undercut its profits, which totalled USD 94 billion on sales of USD 295 billion in its fiscal year ending last September. Another federal judge in April issued a civil contempt order banning Apple from collecting any fees from in-app transactions on the iPhone that are funnelled through other options besides its once-exclusive payment processing system that charged commissions ranging from 15 to 30 per cent. Apple also could lose a more than $20 billion annual payment that it gets for making Google the default search tool on the iPhone and other products as part of another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department. A federal judge in Washington is considering whether to ban the deals with Apple as part of a shake-up being proposed to address Google's illegal monopoly in search. Neals' decision to allow the Justice Department's antitrust case to proceed came on the same day that Apple was hit with a lawsuit by app maker Proton amplifying the accusations of wrongful conduct by the company. The lawsuit, which will seek to be certified as a class action presenting thousands of developers who have made iPhone apps, is asking for punitive damages against Apple, as well as a court order to dismantle its walled garden.

{"custom_id":"art_5306c091-8582-4368-a1ad-2948c0bbc528","method":"POST","url":"/v1/chat/completions","body":{"model":"gpt-4o-2024-08-06","temperature":0,"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"# AI Agent Instructions: Article → Structured JSON\n\n## Context: What You Are Doing\n\nYou are not just summarizing news. You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**CRITICAL RESPONSE LENGTH LIMITS: \n- Maximum 2 business events per article (not 3)\n- Each causal chain exactly 3 steps (not 4-5)\n- Keep descriptions under 50 words each\n- Total response must be under 4000 characters\n- Prioritize the most impactful events only**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

**0.9–1.0**: Official sources (SEC filings, earnings calls, press releases)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Credible reporting (established journalists, verified sources)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Industry speculation (analyst reports, informed estimates)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Rumors with credibility (supply chain leaks, insider reports)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Pure speculation (unverified claims, social media rumors)\n• **0.0**: Known false (contradicted by official sources)\n\n#### Certainty – Impact (0–1)\nConfidence that the event will meaningfully affect Apple's value.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Direct fundamental impact (earnings guidance, major product launch)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong business connection (key partnership, regulatory change)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate relevance (competitive moves, industry trends)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Indirect influence (supply chain issues, market sentiment)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Weak connection (tangential news, minor announcements)\n• **0.0**: No material impact (irrelevant or offsetting factors)\n\n### Emotional Dimensions\n\n#### Hope vs Fear (-1 → +1)\nEmotional valence about future outcomes.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme optimism (\"Apple could dominate this space\")\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Strong hope (\"this looks very promising\")\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild optimism (\"generally positive development\")\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Neutral sentiment (balanced or factual reporting)\n•

**-0.1 to +0.1**: Balanced complexity (neither simple nor complex)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Somewhat complex (\"multiple variables\")\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Quite complex (\"many unknowns\")\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extremely complex (\"too many variables to predict\")\n\n#### Risk Appetite (0–1)\nWillingness to accept uncertainty and potential downsides.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High risk tolerance (embracing bold moves, accepting volatility)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderate risk acceptance (calculated risks, measured optimism)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Balanced approach (weighing pros and cons equally)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Risk-averse (preferring proven approaches, cautious outlook)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Very conservative (avoiding uncertainty, safety-first mentality)\n• **0.0**: Risk-avoidant (rejecting any uncertainty or downside potential)\n\n### Temporal Factors\n\n#### Duration Expectation (0–1)\nPerceived longevity of the issue or its effects.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Permanent/structural (fundamental business model shifts)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Long-term (multi-year implications)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Medium-term (1-2 year effects)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Short-term (quarterly to annual impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Brief impact (weeks to months)\n• **0.0**: Fleeting (daily news cycle, minimal lasting effect)\n\n#### Urgency (0–1)\nHow immediately people think action or attention is required.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate action required (\"must respond today\")\n• **0.7–0.8**: High urgency (\"needs prompt attention\")\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate urgency (\"should address soon\")\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low urgency (\"can wait for proper planning\")\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal urgency (\"long-term consideration\")\n• **0.0**: No urgency (\"vague future relevance\")\n\n### Amplification Metrics\n\n#### Attention Amplification (0–1)\nHow much coverage, social spread, and media amplification is occurring.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Viral/trending (social media explosion, front-page news)\n• **0.7–0.8**: High amplification (multiple major outlets, significant sharing)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate coverage (industry media, some social traction)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited coverage (niche outlets, minimal sharing)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal amplification (single source, little pickup)\n• **0.0**: No amplification (buried news, no social traction)\n\n### Emotional Profile (Array)\nSelect applicable emotions detected in the narrative. Multiple simultaneous emotions are common.\n\n**Core Emotions**: anticipation, excitement, optimism, confidence, relief, satisfaction, interest, surprise, uncertainty, concern, skepticism, disappointment, fear, anger, disgust, indifference\n\n**Market-Specific Emotions**: FOMO (fear of missing out), greed, euphoria, panic, dread, complacency\n\n**Examples**:\n• Accessory launch = [\"indifference\"]\n• AI breakthrough = [\"excitement\", \"anticipation\", \"FOMO\"]\n• Supply chain disruption = [\"concern\", \"uncertainty\"]\n• Competitive threat = [\"fear\", \"skepticism\"]\n\n### Cognitive Biases (Array)\nList identifiable psychological biases influencing interpretation.

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n•

(incremental refresh)\n• **Apple Watch launch**: 0.05-0.08 (new category)\n• **Services push**: 0.08-0.12 (business model shift)\n• **Vision Pro**: 0.03-0.06 (early-stage new category)\n• **Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: AAPL Investors Have Opportunity to Lead Apple Inc. Securities Fraud Lawsuit\nSource: Market Screener\nPublished: 2025-06-29T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/APPLE-INC-4849/news/AAPL-Investors-Have-Opportunity-to-Lead-Apple-Inc-Securities-Fraud-Lawsuit-50360371/\n\nBody:\nWhy: New York, N.Y., June 29, 2025. Rosen Law Firm, a global investor rights law firm, announces the filing of a class action lawsuit on behalf of purchasers of securities of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) between June 10, 2024 and June 9, 2025, both dates inclusive (the \"Class Period\"). A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 19, 2025. So What: If you purchased Apple securities during the Class Period you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out of pocket fees or costs through a contingency fee arrangement. What to do next: To join the Apple class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=40611 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. A class action lawsuit has already been filed. If you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than August 19, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. Why Rosen Law: We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition. Be wise in selecting counsel. The Rosen Law Firm represents investors throughout the globe, concentrating its practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation. Rosen Law Firm achieved the largest ever securities class action settlement against a Chinese Company at the time. Rosen Law Firm was Ranked No. 1 by ISS Securities Class Action Services for number of securities class action settlements in 2017. The firm has been ranked in the top 4 each year since 2013 and has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors. In 2019 alone the firm secured over $438 million for investors. In 2020, founding partner Laurence Rosen was named by law360 as a Titan of Plaintiffs' Bar. Many of the firm's attorneys have been recognized by Lawdragon and Super Lawyers. Details of the case: According to the lawsuit, throughout the Class Period, defendants made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Apple misstated the time it would take to integrate the advanced AI-based Siri features into its devices; (2) Accordingly, it was highly unlikely that these features would be available for the iPhone 16; (3) The lack of such advanced AI-based features would hurt iPhone 16 sales; (4) as a result, Apple's business and/or financial prospects were overstated; and (5) as a result, Apple's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. When the true details entered the market, the lawsuit claims that investors suffered damages. To join the Apple class action, go to https://rosenlegal.com/submit-form/?case_id=40611 or call Phillip Kim, Esq. at 866-767-3653 or email case@rosenlegal.com for more information. No Class Has Been Certified. Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. You may also remain an absent class member and do nothing at this point. An investor's ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff.
