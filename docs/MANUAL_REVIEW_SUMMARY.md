## 🎯 **What We Should Test For**

Based on the working agent, here's what to evaluate:

### **1. Business Event Quality**
- [ ] **Apple Relevance**: Are events actually about Apple?
- [ ] **Event Specificity**: Clear, actionable business developments
- [ ] **Multiple Events**: 1-5 events per article typical
- [ ] **Logical Grouping**: Related events properly connected

### **2. Causal Chain Logic**
- [ ] **Business Sense**: Do cause→effect relationships make sense?
- [ ] **Quantification**: Are impacts measurable/specific?
- [ ] **Time Horizons**: Realistic timeframes for effects
- [ ] **Fundamental Endpoints**: Chains end in revenue/units/margins

### **3. Analysis Depth**
- [ ] **Market Psychology**: Does it capture investor sentiment?
- [ ] **Belief vs Reality**: Gap between market perception and facts
- [ ] **Confidence Calibration**: Uncertainty reflected in scores
- [ ] **Evidence Basis**: Claims supported by article content

## 🚨 **Quality Red Flags to Watch**

### **❌ Bad Signs**
- **Generic Analysis**: Same output for different articles
- **Non-Apple Focus**: Events not relevant to Apple
- **Magnitude Inflation**: Unrealistic impact scores
- **Missing Causality**: Events without logical progression
- **Extreme Confidence**: High certainty on uncertain topics

### **✅ Good Signs**
- **Article-Specific**: Unique analysis per article
- **Apple-Centric**: All events viewed through Apple lens
- **Realistic Scope**: Impact scores match Apple's scale
- **Logical Flow**: Clear cause→effect→fundamental progression
- **Appropriate Uncertainty**: Confidence matches evidence quality
