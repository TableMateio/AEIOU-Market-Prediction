# AEIOU Machine Learning Strategy
*Building the News-to-Alpha Prediction Engine*

## 🎯 **The Core Innovation: Predicting Alpha, Not Returns**

**Your insight about relative performance is brilliant.** Instead of predicting absolute stock movements (noisy, market-dependent), we predict **alpha** - how much better/worse a stock performs vs benchmarks.

### **Why This Works Better**

```
Traditional: News → Stock Price Change (noisy)
AEIOU: News → Alpha vs Market (signal)
```

**Example**: 
- Apple announces new iPhone
- Stock goes up 2%, market goes up 1.5%
- **Alpha = +0.5%** ← This is what we predict
- Removes market noise, isolates news impact

## 🧠 **Random Forest: The Right Choice**

**Why Random Forest > Deep Learning for this problem:**

1. **Handles Mixed Data Types**: Your 50+ factors include numbers, categories, arrays
2. **Feature Importance**: Shows which factors matter most (interpretability)
3. **Robust to Outliers**: Won't break on weird news events
4. **Less Data Hungry**: Works with hundreds of samples, not thousands
5. **Captures Interactions**: Automatically finds factor combinations that matter

**Deep Learning** would need 10x more data and lose interpretability.

## 📊 **The Complete Data Pipeline**

### **Input Data Structure**
```
Business Event → 50+ Factors → Relative Performance Metrics
     ↓              ↓                    ↓
Article      AI Extraction        Alpha Calculations
```

### **Target Variables (What We Predict)**
```python
# Short-term alpha (news reaction)
alpha_vs_market_5min    # Immediate reaction
alpha_vs_market_30min   # Early trading response  
alpha_vs_market_2hour   # Intraday settlement

# Medium-term alpha (fundamental impact)
alpha_vs_market_1day    # Daily close impact
alpha_vs_market_3day    # Follow-through effect
alpha_vs_market_7day    # Weekly trend

# Long-term alpha (business impact)
alpha_vs_market_30day   # Monthly performance

# Sector-specific comparisons
alpha_vs_tech_sector    # vs XLK
alpha_vs_faang         # vs big tech peers

# Risk metrics

## 🔍 **Feature Interaction Discovery**

**Your question about factor combinations is key.** Random Forest automatically finds interactions, but we can enhance this:

### **Automatic Interaction Detection**
```python
# Random Forest finds these automatically:
if (narrative_strength > 0.8 AND surprise_vs_anticipated > 0.7):
    → Higher alpha likely

if (execution_risk > 0.6 AND competitive_risk > 0.5):
    → Lower alpha likely
```

### **Manual Interaction Engineering**
```python
# Create explicit interaction features:
hope_fear_x_narrative = hope_vs_fear * narrative_strength
surprise_x_credibility = surprise_vs_anticipated * source_credibility
optimism_x_risk = optimism_bias * execution_risk
```

### **Feature Importance Analysis**
Random Forest gives you:
1. **Individual feature importance** (which single factors matter)
2. **SHAP values** (how factor combinations work together)
3. **Partial dependence plots** (how factors interact with each other)

---

## 🎪 **Data Quality Maximization**

### **Before Training - Data Strengthening**

**1. Feature Quality Checks**
```python
# Remove low-variance features (always the same value)
variance_threshold = 0.001

# Remove highly correlated features (>95% correlation)
correlation_threshold = 0.95

# Remove features with >50% missing data
missing_threshold = 0.5
```

**2. Target Variable Validation**
```python
# Ensure we have stock data around event times
for each article:
    check stock_prices table for ±24 hours around published_at
    
# Remove events with insufficient benchmark data
required_benchmarks = ['SPY', 'QQQ', 'XLK']
```

**3. Temporal Alignment**
```python
# Critical: Precise timestamp matching
news_time = article.published_at
stock_before = get_closest_price(news_time - 5_minutes)
stock_after = get_closest_price(news_time + 30_minutes)

# Account for market hours
if not is_market_hours(news_time):
    use_next_market_open()
```

**4. Outlier Detection**
```python
# Remove extreme alpha values (likely data errors)
alpha_threshold = 20%  # ±20% alpha is extreme

# Remove articles with insufficient business factors
min_factors_per_article = 3
```

---

## 🧪 **Training & Validation Strategy**

### **Temporal Split (Critical for Finance)**
```python
# Chronological split - never train on future data
training_data = articles[published_at < '2024-03-01']  # 8 months
validation_data = articles[published_at >= '2024-03-01']  # 2 months

# This prevents look-ahead bias
```

### **Cross-Validation Approach**
```python
# Time Series Cross-Validation
for fold in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    train_end = start_date + (fold * 6_weeks)
    test_start = train_end
    test_end = test_start + 2_weeks
    
    train_model(data[start_date:train_end])
    validate_model(data[test_start:test_end])
```

### **Success Metrics**
```python
# Directional Accuracy (most important)
directional_accuracy = mean(sign(predicted) == sign(actual))
target: >60% for 1-day alpha, >55% for 7-day alpha

# Magnitude Accuracy  
r_squared = correlation(predicted, actual) ** 2
target: >0.3 for meaningful predictive power

# Risk-Adjusted Returns
sharpe_ratio = mean(alpha) / std(alpha)
target: >0.5 for tradeable strategy
```

## 🎯 **Prioritizing High-Value Factors**

**Your question about focusing on certain factors:**

### **Feature Selection Pipeline**
```python
# 1. Statistical significance
f_scores = f_regression(X, y)  # F-test for each feature
p_values = f_regression_pvalues(X, y)
keep_features = features[p_values < 0.05]  # Statistically significant

# 2. Mutual information (captures non-linear relationships)
mi_scores = mutual_info_regression(X, y)
top_mi_features = features[top_k_indices(mi_scores, k=30)]

# 3. Business logic prioritization
high_priority_factors = [
    'narrative_strength',      # Market loves stories
    'surprise_vs_anticipated', # Surprises move markets
    'execution_risk',          # Risk assessment crucial
    'source_credibility',      # Source matters for believability
    'hope_vs_fear',           # Emotion drives trading
    'competitive_risk'         # Competition fears
]
```

### **Factor Interaction Prioritization**
```python
# Test specific combinations you suspect matter
priority_interactions = [
    ('narrative_strength', 'source_credibility'),    # Strong story + credible source
    ('hope_vs_fear', 'surprise_vs_anticipated'),     # Emotional surprise
    ('execution_risk', 'timeline_realism'),          # Feasibility assessment
    ('optimism_bias', 'risk_awareness'),             # Perception gaps
]
```

## 💡 **Key Insights & Tips**

### **Data Quality Maximization**
1. **Clean timestamps precisely** - 5-minute errors destroy short-term predictions
2. **Validate business factor extraction** - manually check 20 articles for AI accuracy
3. **Handle market hours correctly** - after-hours news hits differently
4. **Remove survivorship bias** - include failed predictions in training

### **Feature Engineering Tricks**
```python
# Time-based features
hour_of_day = extract_hour(published_at)
day_of_week = extract_dow(published_at)
days_since_earnings = days_since_last_earnings_call()

# Interaction features  
credibility_x_surprise = source_credibility * surprise_vs_anticipated
narrative_x_emotion = narrative_strength * emotional_intensity

# Rolling features
recent_apple_news_count = count_apple_articles_last_7_days()
sector_momentum = tech_sector_performance_last_5_days()
```

### **Model Interpretation**
```python
# After training, answer these questions:
1. Which individual factors predict alpha best?
2. Which factor combinations are most powerful?
3. Do patterns change over time (model decay)?
4. Which time horizons are most predictable?
5. How does accuracy vary by market regime?
```

## 🔮 **What Success Looks Like**

**After 8 months of training:**
```python
# New Apple article published
article = "Apple announces AI partnership with OpenAI"

# Extract business factors
factors = ai_extract_factors(article)

# Predict alpha
predicted_alpha_1day = random_forest.predict(factors)
# → +2.3% alpha vs market

# Confidence interval  
confidence = model.predict_confidence(factors)
# → 73% confidence

# Feature explanation
top_drivers = model.explain_prediction(factors)
# → [("narrative_strength", +0.8%), ("surprise_vs_anticipated", +0.7%), ...]
```

**Validation Results:**
- **67% directional accuracy** on 2-month holdout
- **R² = 0.42** (meaningful predictive power)
- **Sharpe ratio = 0.8** (risk-adjusted profitability)

This is your path to building a **quantified intuition engine** for markets.
