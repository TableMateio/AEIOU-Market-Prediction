# Comprehensive News API Research Brief: Find the Optimal Setup for ML Stock Prediction

## 🎯 **Mission: Find the Best News API Strategy**
We're building a production-grade machine learning system that analyzes news articles to predict Apple stock movements across 15 different time horizons (5 minutes to 1+ years). This is not a hobby project - we need enterprise-quality data collection that can scale to handle serious financial modeling.

**The Challenge**: Most news APIs are either too expensive, lack full content, or don't provide the filtering/historical access we need. We need you to find the optimal combination of APIs, pricing tiers, and collection strategies.

## 📊 **Current Status & Scale Requirements**
- **Current Dataset**: 119 ML training rows from 12 articles (proof of concept complete)
- **Target Phase 1**: 2,000+ ML training rows from 200+ articles (2 months)
- **Target Production**: 10,000+ ML training rows from 1,000+ articles (6 months)
- **Processing Pipeline**: Fully automated - GPT-4o converts articles → structured business factors
- **Stock Data**: Minute-level Apple data via Polygon.io ($79/month)
- **AI Processing**: ~2-3 articles/minute, costs ~$0.50/article in OpenAI tokens

## 🔍 **Critical Requirements for News API**

### **1. Full Article Content (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
- **Must have**: Complete article body text, not just headlines/summaries
- **Why critical**: Our AI system analyzes detailed business reasoning chains from full content
- **Current issue**: Most "financial news APIs" only provide metadata/summaries
- **Confirmed working**: GNews API provides full article content

### **2. Apple-Specific Filtering (ESSENTIAL)**
- **Must have**: Pre-search filtering by company/ticker (Apple/AAPL)
- **Why critical**: Avoid wasting API requests on irrelevant articles
- **Ideal**: Search query like `q="Apple" OR ticker="AAPL"` before retrieval
- **Not acceptable**: Getting 1000 general articles, then filtering locally

### **3. Historical Data Access (REQUIRED)**
- **Minimum**: 1 year of historical data (2024-2025)
- **Ideal**: 2+ years for diverse market conditions
- **Date range**: Must support specific date filtering (e.g., "January 2024 to March 2024")
- **Why needed**: Strategic sampling across different time periods/market conditions

### **4. Volume & Rate Limits**
- **Target collection**: 1,000 quality articles over 2-3 months
- **Daily needs**: ~15-20 articles/day for steady collection
- **Burst needs**: Up to 100 articles/day for historical backlogs
- **Rate limits**: Must support reasonable collection speed (not 1 request/minute)

### **5. Source Diversity (IMPORTANT)**
- **Must have**: Multiple news sources, not single publisher
- **Ideal sources**: Mix of mainstream (Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ) and retail (Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch, Motley Fool)
- **Why important**: Different sources have different perspectives on same events
- **Retail vs Industry**: Need both retail investor sentiment and professional analysis

### **6. Data Quality**
- **Content length**: Articles should be substantial (500+ characters body text)
- **Relevance**: Articles should be genuinely about Apple's business, not just mentions
- **Timeliness**: Articles should have accurate publication timestamps
- **Language**: English only

## 💰 **Budget Constraints**
- **Maximum budget**: $100/month total for news + stock data
- **Current stock costs**: ~$50-80/month (Polygon.io or Alpha Vantage)
- **Available for news**: $20-50/month
- **Consideration**: One-time setup cost acceptable if ongoing costs reasonable

## 🔍 **COMPREHENSIVE API RESEARCH REQUIRED**

**Your Mission**: Research ALL viable news APIs and find the optimal strategy. Don't just verify existing options - discover better alternatives we haven't considered.

### **Tier 1: Known Contenders (Verify & Compare)**

### **Tier 3: Combination Strategies**

**RESEARCH QUESTION**: What's the optimal multi-API strategy?

#### **Scenario A: Primary + Backup**
- Primary API for bulk collection (e.g., GNews Essential €49.99)
- Backup API for additional sources (e.g., NewsAPI.org free tier)
- **Total cost**: €49.99 + free = ~$53/month

#### **Scenario B: Specialized Combination**

2. **Hidden Gem Discovery**: Which financial data providers (Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, etc.) offer news APIs we've overlooked?

3. **Enterprise vs Consumer**: Are there professional-grade APIs (Reuters, Bloomberg) with affordable developer tiers?

4. **Combination Optimization**: What's the best multi-API strategy to maximize articles while minimizing cost?

5. **Historical Backfill**: Which APIs offer the most efficient way to collect 2+ years of Apple articles?

### **Technical Deep Dive Questions**
6. **Content Quality Verification**: For each API, test actual article content - full text or truncated?

7. **Apple Filtering Precision**: Which APIs let you search `ticker:AAPL OR company:"Apple Inc"` before retrieval?

8. **Rate Limit Optimization**: What are the actual rate limits and how can we maximize collection speed?

9. **Source Overlap Analysis**: How much duplicate content exists between different APIs?

10. **Integration Complexity**: Which APIs have the best documentation and developer experience?
