Plan of Action

Plan of Action for Building a Stock Prediction Model Based on News Analysis

⸻

Phase 1: Data Collection and Preparation
1.Gather Historical News Data (Focus on Apple)
•Use news APIs like Alpha Vantage, Koyfin, Seeking Alpha, or Benzinga to collect articles related to Apple over the last 3-5 years.
•Action: Set up automated scripts to pull all relevant articles, including timestamps, from news aggregators.
•Goal: Create a dataset of news headlines and full articles for further analysis.
2.Collect Historical Stock Data
•Use financial data APIs such as IEX Cloud or Yahoo Finance to collect intra-day stock prices, volume, and other relevant metrics for Apple.
•Action: For each news event, gather stock price data for 7-14 days before and after the news release.
•Goal: Create a dataset that links stock price movements with specific news events.
3.Label and Organize Data
•Action: Organize data by linking each news article to the corresponding stock movement.
•Goal: Label each article’s impact (positive/negative/neutral) and key factors such as product launches, regulations, or earnings.

⸻

Phase 2: Preprocessing and Initial Analysis
1.Relevance Filtering and Summarization
•Use GPT-3.5 or other NLP models to filter irrelevant articles and summarize the core points of each article.
•Action: Develop a script that removes duplicate or repetitive articles, focusing on those that reveal new information.
•Goal: Streamline the dataset by keeping only significant articles.
2.Feature Extraction and Annotation
•Action: Use NLP models to extract features (e.g., product launches, AI features, market expansions) and annotate key factors driving stock movement.
•Goal: Create a feature-rich dataset, linking business events to stock movements.
3.Sentiment Analysis
•Apply sentiment analysis to the news data to assess the tone of the coverage (positive, negative, neutral).
•Action: Implement sentiment analysis models to label the sentiment and assess its correlation with stock price movements.
•Goal: Quantify how the tone of news coverage influences stock movements.

Phase 3: Building and Training Prediction Models
1.Identify High-Impact News Factors
•Action: Use historical data to identify which types of news have the largest impact on stock prices (e.g., product releases, legal battles, market trends).
•Goal: Prioritize features that drive stock movement for model training.
2.Train Machine Learning Models
•Use machine learning tools (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to train models that predict stock movements based on past data.
•Action: Train regression or decision tree models to predict the direction and magnitude of stock price changes.
•Goal: Build a predictive model that identifies stock movements from news factors with high accuracy.
3.Test on Historical Data
•Action: Back-test the model using the past 3-5 years of data to assess accuracy.
•Goal: Validate the model’s ability to predict stock movements based on historical news and stock data.

⸻

Phase 4: Evaluation and Optimization
1.Refine Predictions with Real-Time Data
•Action: Incorporate real-time news articles and stock data to test the system’s ability to make timely predictions.
•Goal: Assess how early the model can predict stock movements after news events are published.
2.Improve Accuracy Through Iteration
•Use insights from real-time performance to adjust the model.
•Action: Tune hyperparameters, experiment with different models, and add additional news categories (e.g., federal financial trends).
•Goal: Increase the model’s prediction accuracy and responsiveness.

⸻

Phase 5: Deployment and Scalability
1.Create Automated Pipelines
•Action: Automate the ingestion of new articles, sentiment analysis, and stock predictions using tools like Apache Airflow for data pipelines.
•Goal: Ensure continuous, real-time analysis of news articles and stock predictions.
2.Scale to Multiple Companies
•Once successful with Apple, expand the model to predict stock movements for other companies.
•Action: Use the same approach to analyze multiple stocks, adjusting factors relevant to different industries.
•Goal: Scale the system to make predictions for a wider range of companies.
