You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**RESPONSE LENGTH: Keep your analysis focused and concise. Limit to 2-3 business events per article maximum. Each causal chain should be 3-5 steps, not longer. Avoid excessive detail that could cause response truncation.**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does

(conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*:

Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this

Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: US considers a rare antitrust move: breaking up Google\nSource: ArcaMax\nPublished: 2024-08-14T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.arcamax.com/business/businessnews/s-3368532\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON -- A rare bid to break up Alphabet Inc.'s Google is one of the options being considered by the Justice Department after a landmark court ruling found that the company monopolized the online search market, according to people with knowledge of the deliberations. The move would be Washington's first push to dismantle a company for illegal monopolization since unsuccessful efforts to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Less severe options include forcing Google to share more data with competitors and measures to prevent it from gaining an unfair advantage in AI products, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private conversations. Regardless, the government will likely seek a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of its case against Google. If the Justice Department pushes ahead with a breakup plan, the most likely units for divestment are the Android operating system and Google's web browser Chrome, said the people. Officials are also looking at trying to force a possible sale of AdWords, the platform the company uses to sell text advertising, one of the people said. The Justice Department discussions have intensified in the wake of Judge Amit Mehta's Aug. 5 ruling that Google illegally monopolized the markets of online search and search text ads. Google has said it will appeal that decision, but Mehta has ordered both sides to begin plans for the second phase of the case, which will involve the government's proposals for restoring competition, including a possible breakup request. Alphabet shares fell as much as 2.5% to $160.11 in after-hours trading before erasing some losses. A Google spokesman declined to comment on the possible remedy. A Justice Department spokeswoman also declined to comment. The U.S. plan will need to be accepted by Mehta, who would direct the company to comply. A forced breakup of Google would be the biggest of a U.S. company since AT&T was dismantled in the 1980s. Justice Department attorneys, who have been consulting with companies affected by Google's practices, have raised concerns in their discussions that the company's search dominance gives it advantages in developing artificial intelligence technology, the people said. As part of a remedy, the government might seek to stop the company from forcing websites to allow their content to be used for some of Google's AI products in order to appear in search results. Divesting the Android operating system, used on about 2.5 billion devices worldwide, is one of the remedies that's been most frequently discussed by Justice Department attorneys, according to the people. In his decision, Mehta found that Google requires device makers to sign agreements to gain access to its apps like Gmail and the Google Play Store. Those agreements also require that Google's search widget and Chrome browser be installed on devices in such a way they can't be deleted, effectively preventing other search engines from competing, he found. Mehta's decision follows a verdict by a California jury in December that found the company monopolized Android app distribution. A judge in that case hasn't yet decided on relief. The Federal Trade Commission, which also enforces antitrust laws, filed a brief in that case this week and said in a statement that Google shouldn't be allowed \"to reap the rewards of illegal monopolization.\" Google paid as much as $26 billion to companies to make its search engine the default on devices and in web browsers, with $20 billion of that going to Apple Inc. Mehta's ruling also found Google monopolized the advertisements that appear at the top of a search results page to draw users to websites, known as search text ads. Those are sold via Google Ads, which was rebranded from AdWords in 2018 and offers marketers a way to run ads against certain search keywords related to their business. About two-thirds of Google's total revenue comes from search ads, amounting to more than $100 billion in 2020, according to testimony from last year's trial. If the Justice Department doesn't call for Google to sell off AdWords, it could ask for interoperability requirements that would make it work seamlessly on other search engines, the people said. Another option would require Google to divest or license its data to rivals, such as Microsoft's Bing or DuckDuckGo. Mehta's ruling found that Google's contracts ensure not only that its search engine gets the most user data - 16 times as much as its next closest competitor -- but that data stream also keeps its rivals from improving their search results and competing effectively. Europe's recently enacted digital gatekeeper rules imposed a similar requirement that Google make available some of its data to third-party search engines. The company has said publicly that sharing data can pose user privacy concerns, so it only makes available information on searches that meet certain thresholds. Requiring monopolists to allow rivals to have some access to technology has been a remedy in previous cases. In the Justice Department's first case against AT&T in 1956, the company was required to provide royalty-free licenses to its patents. In the antitrust case against Microsoft, the settlement required the Redmond, Washington, tech giant to make some of its so-called application programming interfaces, or APIs, available to third-parties for free. APIs are used to ensure that software programs can effectively communicate and exchange data with each other. For years, websites have allowed Google's web crawler access to ensure they appear in the company's search results. But more recently some of that data has been used to help Google develop its AI. Last fall, Google created a tool to allow websites to block scraping for AI, after companies complained. But that opt-out doesn't apply to everything. In May, Google announced that some searches will now come with \"AI Overviews,\" narrative responses that spare people the task of clicking through various links. The AI-powered panel appears underneath queries, presenting summarized information drawn from Google search results from across the web. Google doesn't allow website publishers to opt-out of appearing in AI Overviews, since those are a \"feature\" of search, not a separate product. Websites can block Google from using snippets, but that applies to both search and the AI Overviews.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**RESPONSE LENGTH: Keep your analysis focused and concise. Limit to 2-3 business events per article maximum. Each causal chain should be 3-5 steps, not longer. Avoid excessive detail that could cause response truncation.**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

markets with general optimism, growth expectations\n• **bear**: Declining markets with pessimism, contraction fears\n• **neutral**: Stable or mixed market conditions, balanced sentiment\n• **unknown**: Market regime signals present but unclear/conflicting\n• **null**: No market regime context determinable from article\n\n### Regime Sensitivity Factors\nFor each step in causal chains, assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current narrative)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Regime-neutral (independent of market context)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Slightly counter-regime (mild contradiction to sentiment)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Moderately counter-regime (challenges current narrative)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Strongly counter-regime (good news in bear market, bad news in bull market)\n\n#### Reframing Potential (0–1)\nHow easily can this event be reframed to fit dominant narrative.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly reframable (ambiguous interpretation, easily spun either way)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderately reframable (some spin possible with

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n•

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**RESPONSE LENGTH: Keep your analysis focused and concise. Limit to 2-3 business events per article maximum. Each causal chain should be 3-5 steps, not longer. Avoid excessive detail that could cause response truncation.**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven

complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n####

effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Traders bet big on Fed moving into rescue mode\nSource: The Star \nPublished: 2024-08-05T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2024/08/06/traders-bet-big-on-fed-moving-into-rescue-mode\n\nBody:\nNew York: Bond traders are piling into bets that the US economy is on the verge of deteriorating so quickly that the US Federal Reserve (Fed) will need to start easing monetary policy aggressively to head off a recession. Previous worries about the risk of elevated inflation have virtually disappeared, swiftly giving way to speculation that growth will stall unless the central bank starts pulling interest rates down from a more than two-decade high. That is fuelling one of the biggest bond-market rallies since fears of a banking crisis flared in March 2023. The advance has been so strong that the policy sensitive two-year Treasury yield tumbled last week by half a percentage point to less than 3.9%. It hasn't been that far below the Fed's benchmark rate - now around 5.3% - since the global financial crisis or the aftermath of the dot-com crash. The moves extended in Asia trading yesterday with two-year yields slumping more than 10 basis points to 3.77% as bonds rallied across the curve. \"The market concern is that the Fed is lagging and that we are morphing from a soft landing to a hard landing,\" said Tracy Chen, a portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment Management. \"Treasuries are a good buy here because I do think the economy will continue to slow.\" Bond traders have repeatedly misjudged where interest rates have been headed since the end of the pandemic, however, at times overshooting in both directions and caught off guard when the economy bucked recession calls or inflation defied expectations. At the end of 2023, bond prices also surged on conviction that the Fed was poised to start easing policy, only to give back those gains when the economy kept exhibiting surprising strength. So there's a chance that the latest move is another such swing too far. \"The market is overshooting and getting ahead of itself like we saw late last year,\" said Kevin Flanagan, head of fixed-income strategy at WisdomTree. \"You need validation from more data.\" But sentiment has shifted sharply after a string of data showed a softening job market and cooling in segments of the economy. Last Friday, the US Labor Department reported that employers created just 114,000 jobs in July, far short of what economists were forecasting, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly rose. After the Fed last Wednesday again held rates steady, the data fanned worries that the central bank has been too slow to react - just as it was in raising interest rates once inflation lingered well after the economy reopened from the pandemic. That's been reinforced by the fact that central banks in Canada and Europe have already started easing policy. Fears of a slowing economy and Fed delays have contributed to a sharp sell-off in US stocks last week, with sentiment further dented over the weekend after Berkshire Hathaway Inc slashed its stake in Apple Inc by almost 50% as part of a massive second-quarter selling spree. \"There's been an absolutely enormous move in the two-year yield in the past 10 days or so. It's hard to price a so-called safe-haven asset, it's much harder to price riskier assets - stocks,\" said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC. \"And Warren Buffett's decision to lighten up his Apple position doesn't help things from a sentiment perspective.\" Economists across Wall Street have started anticipating a more aggressive pace of Fed easing, with those at Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co predicting half-percentage-point moves at the September and November meetings. Last Sunday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc economists increased the probability of a US recession in the next year to 25% from 15%, but said there are several reasons not to fear a slump. The economy continues to look \"fine overall\", there are no major financial imbalances and the Fed has a lot of room to cut rates and can do so quickly if needed, the economists said. Futures traders are pricing in roughly the equivalent of five quarter-point cuts through the end of the year, indicating expectations for unusually large half-point moves over the course of its last three meetings. Downward moves of that scale haven't been enacted since the pandemic or the credit crisis. -- Bloomberg\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_event_chain_article","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts (NOT quoted people)","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability and market impact of the publication source (0.9-1.0 = Tier 1 sources like WSJ/Bloomberg Terminal, 0.7-0.8 = Major business media like Reuters/CNBC, 0.5-0.6 = Established tech publications like TechCrunch/Benzinga, 0.3-0.4 = Industry blogs/smaller publications, 0.1-0.2 = Personal blogs/social media, 0.0 = Known unreliable sources)"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record and expertise of the specific author(s) (0.9-1.0 = Top-tier journalists like Mark Gurman, 0.7-0.8 = Experienced analysts/senior reporters, 0.5-0.6 = Regular reporters with some expertise, 0.3-0.4 = Junior reporters/freelancers, 0.1-0.2 = Unknown authors, null = Author credibility undeterminable)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted/referenced in the article (0.9-1.0 = Direct company statements/CEO quotes/earnings calls, 0.7-0.8 = Named executives/regulatory filings, 0.5-0.6 = Industry analysts/named expert sources, 0.3-0.4 = Unnamed positioned sources, 0.1-0.2 = Anonymous tips/social media speculation, 0.0 = Contradicted/known false sources)"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience being addressed (institutional = professional investors/hedge funds, retail = individual investors/everyday people, both = explicitly relevant to both audiences, neither = general business audience/non-investment focused)"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between underlying event occurrence and article publication in days with decimal precision (0.0 = real-time, 0.1 = ~2-3 hours, 0.5 = ~12 hours, 1.0 = next day, 3.5 = 3.5 days after event, null = unknown timing relationship)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context mentioned or implied in the article (bull = rising markets with optimism, bear = declining markets with pessimism, neutral = stable/mixed conditions, unknown = no clear regime signals, null = regime not determinable from article content)","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected or extracted business events","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category (e.g., Product_Announcement = pre-release comms; Product_Launch = availability; M&A = deal completion/announcement; etc.)"},"trigger":{"type":"string","description":"How the news surfaced","enum":["press_release","earnings_call","filing","analyst_report","media_report","rumor","social","other"]},"entities":{"type":"array","description":"Companies or organizations involved","items":{"type":"string"}},"scope":{"type":"string","description":"Impacted scope","enum":["company","industry"]},"orientation":{"type":"string","description":"Perspective","enum":["predictive","reflective","both","neutral"]},"time_horizon_days":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"description":"Overall relevance window of this event in days"},"tags":{"type":"array","description":"Reusable tags (e.g., company, product name, quoted people, themes like 'supply chain', 'innovation')","items":{"type":"string"}},"quoted_people":{"type":"array","description":"Individuals quoted in the article (separate from authors)","items":{"type":"string"}},"event_description":{"type":"string","description":"Optional natural-language summary of the top-level event"},"causal_chain":{"type":"array","description":"Sequence of causal steps; step=0 is the triggering event.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into business events and their causal consequences. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the causal events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple and all of the chains are through the lens of how they will affect Apple.\n\nEach event should unfold into a chain of 3–5 causal steps that ends at fundamentals (units sold, revenue, costs, margins, market share). You may include intermediate, scalar proxies (e.g., competitiveness_index, differentiation_score, product_awareness) — but they are bridges, not endpoints. Within 1–2 steps after a proxy, terminate at a fundamental.\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. Intermediate proxies must be quantified (unit = index, rating, %, binary, or count). Examples: competitiveness_index (index), product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), price_premium (%), channel_coverage_index (index). Proxies are allowed only if they point clearly to a fundamental in the next link(s)\n\nYou are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart). Each should be its own business_event with separate causal chains.**\n\n**Event Separation Guidance**: Consider separating events that serve different customer segments, have different risk profiles, or occur >12 months apart. Use judgment based on distinct business value propositions rather than rigid timeline rules.\n\n**RESPONSE LENGTH: Keep your analysis focused and concise. Limit to 2-3 business events per article maximum. Each causal chain should be 3-5 steps, not longer. Avoid excessive detail that could cause response truncation.**\n\n1. **Multiple events per article** — capture each distinct event separately.\n2. **Atomic causal steps** — one measurable factor per step. Factors may be proxies (e.g., product_awareness, competitiveness_index) or fundamentals (units, revenue, costs, margins, market share). Proxies must have a unit (index/rating/%/binary/count) and lead to a fundamental within 1–2 steps.\n3. **Chain length** — aim for 3–5 steps after step 0. It's typical to see 1–2 proxy links before fundamentals. Allow branching when a proxy drives multiple fundamentals.\n4. **Evidence levels** — explicit (stated), implied (logical), model (pattern-based).\n5. **Scope** — company if a firm is named; else industry.\n6. **Cognitive and Emotional Factors**\n\n### Core Psychological Metrics\n\n#### Intensity (0–1)\nMarket attention and emotional buzz level.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Maximum fixation (market

Markets often move on perception rather than fundamentals, creating gaps between sentiment and likely outcomes.\n\n### Market Perception Layer\nWhat investors and the market are actually feeling/believing, based on how the news is being covered and discussed:\n- **Dominant narrative** being told in media coverage\n- **Emotional sentiment** driving investor discussions  \n- **Cognitive biases** visible in market reactions\n- **Hype vs skepticism** levels in analyst/social commentary\n**This is NOT your AI opinion - this is reading the room of actual market sentiment.**\n\n### AI Assessment Layer  \nYour data-driven, realistic assessment of what will likely happen in business reality. **CRITICAL: All assessment values should scale with the magnitude of the factor.** If magnitude is 0.01 (tiny impact), then competitive_risk, execution_risk, etc. should also be low values (0.05-0.15). If magnitude is 0.5 (massive impact), then risks can be proportionally higher.\n\n**This is YOUR analytical judgment** - often more conservative than market hype. Markets tend to overestimate impact of small events.\n\nEach causal step should have its own assessment - early steps (like \"announce new feature\") typically have different risk profiles than distant steps (like \"revenue growth\"):\n\n#### Execution Risk (0–1)\nLikelihood of implementation challenges and practical barriers.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Extremely high risk (complex technology, unproven at scale, major operational challenges)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Significant challenges expected (difficult but achievable, resource-intensive)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate implementation difficulty (standard complexity, manageable risks)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Some risks but manageable (proven approaches, minor challenges)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low execution risk (straightforward implementation, established processes)\n• **0.0**: Trivial to execute (simple operational changes, minimal barriers)\n\n#### Competitive Risk (0–1)\nRisk that competitive dynamics will undermine this specific causal step. **Scale with magnitude**: tiny factors (0.01) should have tiny risks (0.05), massive factors (0.5) can have proportional risks.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Competitors likely to neutralize impact (fast follower advantage, existing solutions)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong competitive response expected (direct threat to competitor revenue)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate competitive pressure (some competitor reaction likely)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Limited competitive threat (differentiated approach, first-mover advantage)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Minimal competitive risk (unique capabilities, high switching costs)\n• **0.05–0.1**: Tiny competitive risk (for minor updates, accessories, routine changes)\n• **0.0**: No competitive threat (proprietary advantage, market leadership)\n\n#### Business Impact Likelihood (0–1)\nProbability this event will have the claimed business impact. **For tiny magnitudes (0.01), use conservative confidence (0.2-0.4)** since small effects are harder to detect and achieve.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly likely to achieve claimed impact (proven track record, clear mechanisms)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Probably will deliver (strong indicators, favorable conditions)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Uncertain outcome (mixed signals, dependent on execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Probably won't meet expectations (challenging conditions, weak indicators)\n• **0.2–0.3**: Low confidence (typical for minor changes with unclear business impact)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely to deliver (poor track record, unfavorable conditions)\n• **0.0**: Almost certain to fail (fundamental barriers, impossible conditions)\n\n#### Timeline Realism (0–1)\nRealism of proposed timeline and delivery schedule.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Very realistic timeline (conservative estimates, proven delivery capability)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Achievable with effort (reasonable timeline, some stretch goals)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Ambitious but possible (tight timeline, requires good execution)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Overly optimistic (compressed timeline, high risk of delays)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unrealistic timeline (impossible schedule, ignores constraints)\n• **0.0**: Impossible schedule (physically impossible, contradicts reality)\n\n#### Fundamental Strength (0–1)\nHow sound the underlying business logic is for this specific causal step.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Rock-solid business logic (proven causal mechanisms, strong historical precedent)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Sound business reasoning (logical connection, supported by evidence)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Reasonable logic (plausible connection, some supporting data)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Weak business case (tenuous connection, limited supporting evidence)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Poor business logic (speculative connection, contradicts evidence)\n• **0.0**: Fundamentally flawed reasoning (no logical connection, contradicts known patterns)\n\n### Perception Gap Analysis\nThe tension between market belief and analytical assessment:\n\n#### Optimism Bias (-1 → +1)\nIs market over or under-confident compared to analytical assessment?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Extreme market overconfidence (euphoric, ignoring major risks)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Significant overoptimism (market too bullish vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Mild overconfidence (slightly too optimistic)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Well-calibrated (market perception matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Mild underconfidence (market slightly too pessimistic)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Significant pessimism bias (market too bearish vs reality)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Extreme market underconfidence (panic, ignoring positives)\n\n#### Risk Awareness (-1 → +1)\nHow well does market understand the real risks compared to analytical view?\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Market over-estimates risks (paranoid, seeing problems everywhere)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Market somewhat risk-averse (conservative vs reality)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Market slightly overcautious (minor risk overestimation)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Appropriate risk assessment (market matches analysis)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Market slightly underestimates risks (minor blind spots)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Market significantly ignores risks (dangerous complacency)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Market completely blind to risks (reckless disregard)\n\n#### Correction Potential (0–1)\nLikelihood of market perception shifting toward analytical reality.\n• **0.9–1.0**: High correction potential (clear catalysts, unsustainable narrative)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Likely correction (mounting evidence, narrative strain)\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate correction chance (mixed signals, gradual shift possible)\n• **0.3–0.4**: Low correction potential (entrenched views, limited catalysts)\n• **0.1–0.2**: Unlikely correction (strong narrative momentum, few catalysts)\n• **0.0**: No correction expected (permanent perception gap, no catalysts)\n\n### Examples of Dual-Layer Analysis:\n\n**Foldable iPhone Entry**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Apple will perfect foldables and dominate the category\" (high optimism)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Late entry with significant technical/competitive risks\" (moderate pessimism)  \n- *Perception Gap*: Market underestimating Samsung's lead and execution complexity\n\n**Supply Chain Diversification**:\n- *Market Perception*: \"Boring operational change, minimal impact\" (low interest)\n- *AI Assessment*: \"Major strategic shift reducing China risk\" (high long-term value)\n- *Perception Gap*: Market undervaluing geopolitical risk mitigation\n\nThis dual-layer approach helps predict:\n- **Short-term moves** (driven by perception/sentiment)\n- **Long-term corrections** (when analysis proves more accurate)  \n- **Volatility opportunities** (when gaps become obvious to market)\n\n## Credibility Assessment\n\n### Publisher Credibility (0–1)\nReliability and market

markets with general optimism, growth expectations\n• **bear**: Declining markets with pessimism, contraction fears\n• **neutral**: Stable or mixed market conditions, balanced sentiment\n• **unknown**: Market regime signals present but unclear/conflicting\n• **null**: No market regime context determinable from article\n\n### Regime Sensitivity Factors\nFor each step in causal chains, assess how market context influences event interpretation:\n\n#### Regime Alignment (-1 → +1)\nHow much this event aligns with current market regime expectations.\n• **+0.8 to +1.0**: Perfectly aligned (bad news in bear market, good news in bull market)\n• **+0.4 to +0.7**: Moderately aligned (reinforces current sentiment)\n• **+0.1 to +0.3**: Slightly aligned (somewhat fits current narrative)\n• **-0.1 to +0.1**: Regime-neutral (independent of market context)\n• **-0.1 to -0.3**: Slightly counter-regime (mild contradiction to sentiment)\n• **-0.4 to -0.7**: Moderately counter-regime (challenges current narrative)\n• **-0.8 to -1.0**: Strongly counter-regime (good news in bear market, bad news in bull market)\n\n#### Reframing Potential (0–1)\nHow easily can this event be reframed to fit dominant narrative.\n• **0.9–1.0**: Highly reframable (ambiguous interpretation, easily spun either way)\n• **0.7–0.8**: Moderately reframable (some spin possible with

(completely validates current narrative)\n\n## Magnitude Scale (0-1 Decimal Scale)\n\n**CRITICAL**: Use 0-1 decimal scale representing % of Apple's ~$100B annual net income.\n\n### Scale Definition:\n• **0.01** = 1% of profits (~$1B effect) - Major iPhone refresh\n• **0.05** = 5% of profits (~$5B effect) - Significant new product line\n• **0.10** = 10% of profits (~$10B effect) - Major services expansion\n• **0.25** = 25% of profits (~$25B effect) - New industry entry (AR glasses at scale)\n• **0.50** = 50% of profits (~$50B effect) - Transformative shift (cars/healthcare)\n• **1.00** = 100% of profits (~$100B effect) - Company doubling (new trillion-dollar category)\n\n### Practical Guidelines:\n• **0.01–0.03** = iPhone/iPad refreshes, minor new products\n• **0.04–0.08** = Major product launches, significant service updates\n• **0.09–0.15** = New product categories, major strategic shifts\n• **0.16–0.25** = Industry-changing innovations (AR, major M&A)\n•

**Hypothetical Apple Car**: 0.30-0.70 (industry transformation)\n\n### CRITICAL GUARDRAIL:\n**Do not assign values >0.25 unless the event is plausibly on the scale of cars, healthcare, or AI breakthroughs that could reshape entire industries.**\n\n⸻\n\n## Causal Reasoning Assessment\n\nFor each step in a causal chain, evaluate the strength and logic of the causal connection.\n\n### Causal Certainty (0–1)\nHow certain is this step given the previous one?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Nearly inevitable\n  - Direct mechanical relationships (price cut → demand increase)\n  - Well-established patterns (earnings beat → stock price rise)\n  - Physical/operational necessities (supply shortage → delivery delays)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Highly probable\n  - Strong historical correlations (iPhone launch → revenue growth)\n  - Market-tested relationships (innovation → competitive advantage)\n  - Logical business connections (cost reduction → margin improvement)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderately likely\n  - Reasonable but uncertain (new market entry → market share gain)\n  - Context-dependent outcomes (R&D investment → future innovation)\n  - Industry-typical patterns with variation (marketing spend → brand awareness)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Possible but uncertain\n  - Speculative connections (patent filing → future product)\n  - Early-stage relationships (startup acquisition → talent retention)\n  - Complex multi-factor dependencies (regulation change → business impact)\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Low probability\n  - Weak or unproven links (executive hire → culture change)\n  - Long-term speculative chains (basic research → commercial product)\n  - Highly variable outcomes (legal case → settlement terms)\n\n### Logical Directness (0–1)\nHow direct is the causal connection (vs requiring intermediate steps)?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Immediate, direct causation\n  - No intermediate steps required (price increase → revenue increase)\n  - Direct operational impact (factory closure → reduced production)\n  - Immediate market response (earnings miss → stock decline)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: One clear intermediate step\n  - Single logical link (product improvement → customer satisfaction → retention)\n  - Direct but delayed (investment → development → product launch)\n  - Clear mechanism (acquisition → talent → capability)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Multiple intermediate steps\n  - Two or three logical connections (research → innovation → differentiation → market share)\n  - Some uncertainty in intermediate links\n  - Clear end-to-end logic but complex path\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Many intermediate steps\n  - Complex causal chains with multiple dependencies\n  - Uncertain intermediate mechanisms\n  - Long-term indirect effects\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Highly indirect\n  - Many uncertain intermediate steps\n  - Weak logical connections\n  - Speculative end-to-end relationships\n\n### Market Consensus on Causality (0–1)\nHow much does the market agree this causal step makes sense?\n\n**Guidelines**:\n• **0.9–1.0**: Universal agreement\n  - Textbook business relationships (cost cutting → margins)\n  - Widely accepted market principles (quality → brand value)\n  - Standard analyst frameworks (user growth → revenue)\n\n• **0.7–0.8**: Strong consensus\n  - Generally accepted relationships (innovation → competitiveness)\n  - Established industry patterns (scale → efficiency)\n  - Common investment themes (ecosystem → stickiness)\n\n• **0.5–0.6**: Moderate agreement\n  - Some debate but generally accepted (platform strategy → dominance)\n  - Context-dependent relationships (regulation → opportunity/threat)\n  - Mixed track record (acquisition → synergies)\n\n• **0.3–0.4**: Mixed views\n  - Significant disagreement among experts\n  - Unproven or controversial relationships\n  - High variability in historical outcomes\n\n• **0.1–0.2**: Disputed causality\n  - Widely questioned relationships\n  - Poor historical track record\n  - Alternative explanations preferred\n\n• **0.0**: Rejected logic\n  - Broadly dismissed causal claims\n  - Contradicted by evidence or theory\n  - Illogical or impossible relationships\n\n## Factor Creation Guidelines\n\n### Factor Naming Strategy\nCreate specific, measurable factor names that capture the essence of business changes. Prefer concrete concepts over abstract ones.\n\n### Factor Categories (Examples, Not Exhaustive)\n\n**Product Innovation**: ai_feature_integration, form_factor_innovation_index, ecosystem_lock_strength, platform_stickiness, differentiation_score\n\n**Financial Performance**: revenue_growth_rate, gross_margin, operating_margin, units_sold, costs, dividend_yield, share_buyback_amount, earnings_per_share\n\n**Market Position**: market_share, competitive_advantage_sustainability, brand_preference_share, consideration_rate, purchase_intent_score\n\n**Customer Behavior**: customer_retention_rate, customer_satisfaction_index, churn_rate, average_revenue_per_user, customer_lifetime_value\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: supply_chain_diversification, manufacturing_efficiency_index, inventory_turnover, cost_per_unit, delivery_time\n\n**Strategic Assets**: patent_portfolio_strength, talent_acquisition_rate, regulatory_compliance_score, partnership_network_value\n\n### Factor Normalization Strategy\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. The goal is to balance novel factor discovery with standardization:\n\n1. **Novel factors are encouraged** - especially for unique business events\n2. **Common factors should converge** - use standard names for recurring concepts  \n3. **Synonyms help pattern matching** - use factor_synonyms for semantic richness\n4. **Category classification** - helps group similar factors across novel naming\n\n### Proxies (Intermediate Factors)\nAllowed but must lead to fundamentals within 1-2 steps:\n\n**Competitive Position**: competitiveness_index (index), differentiation_score (index), competitive_advantage_sustainability (index)\n**Market Perception**: product_awareness (rating), brand_preference_share (%), consideration_rate (%), purchase_intent_score (index)  \n**Operational Quality**: efficiency_index (index), quality_score (index), reliability_rating (rating)\n**Strategic Position**: ecosystem_strength (index), platform_value (index), network_effects_power (index)\n\n**Rule**: Proxies are allowed, but must point to a fundamental within the next 1–2 steps.\n\n### Natural Factor Progression in Causal Chains\nFactors naturally progress from novel/unique at the beginning of causal chains to standardized/fundamental at the end. Early steps (step 0-1) often involve unique business events like \"ai_feature_integration\" or \"supply_chain_diversification\", while later steps (step 2-4) converge on universal fundamentals like \"revenue_growth_rate\" and \"units_sold\". This progression is expected and beneficial for analysis.\n\n### Post-Processing Normalization Note\nAfter initial factor extraction, factors will be normalized across articles for machine learning analysis. Consistent factor naming following these guidelines will minimize the normalization effort required. Novel factors that emerge frequently across articles may become standard factors in future iterations.\n\n• **factor_synonyms** (optional): Array of related factor concepts that describe the same mechanism. Examples: for \"ecosystem_lock_strength\" you might include [\"platform_stickiness\", \"switching_cost_barrier\", \"vendor_lockin_index\"]. This provides semantic richness for pattern matching across articles.\n• **factor_category**: financial | sales | customer | product | operations | supply_chain | regulatory | legal | hr | marketing | partnerships | external | other.\n• **factor_unit**: %, $, days, count, index, ratio, rating, binary, n/a.\n• **raw_value / delta**: Use numbers when available; omit \"+\" (positive is implicit). Examples: raw_value: 2,000,000; delta: 10 (pp or % as appropriate). If unknown, use null.\n• **description**: Short, plain explanation of the change.\n• **magnitude**: 0–1 scale of business impact (see calibration above).\n• **evidence_level/source/citation**: Use categorical source (article_text, press_release, analyst_report, company_statement, model_inference). Citation optional but encouraged.\n• **quoted_people**: Distinguish from authors. Capture key quoted individuals here if relevant.\n\n⸻\n\n**IMPORTANT: Use the detailed rubrics provided for each belief factor. Don't default to moderate scores (0.4-0.6 range) - if the rubric suggests extreme values based on the evidence, use them. Avoid clustering around middle values when clear evidence supports higher or lower scores.**\n\n## Example\n\n**Article**: \"Analyst says Apple to (1) introduce iPhone 17 redesign, (2) launch foldable

CONTENT:\n=================\nTitle: Google has an illegal monopoly on search, US judge finds\nSource: Yahoo! Finance\nPublished: 2024-08-05T00:00:00.000Z\nAuthors: Unknown\nURL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-judge-rules-google-broke-185454039.html\n\nBody:\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) -Alphabet's Google broke the law with monopolistic behavior over online search and related advertising, a federal judge ruled on Monday, the first victory for U.S. antitrust authorities who have filed numerous lawsuits challenging Big Tech's market dominance. The decision is a significant win for the Justice Department, which had sued the search engine giant over its control of about 90% of the online search market, and 95% on smartphones. \"The court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\" U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta wrote. His ruling against Google paves the way for a second trial to determine potential fixes, such as breaking up the company or requiring the company to stop paying smartphone makers billions of dollars annually to set Google as the default search engine on new phones. Ultimately, Google will have a chance to appeal the court's rulings to the U.S. District Court of Appeal for the D.C. Circuit. Shares of Google parent Alphabet fell 4.3% on Monday as part of a broad tech share decline. Mehta noted that Google had paid $26.3 billion in 2021 alone to ensure that its search engine is the default on smartphones and browsers, and to keep its dominant market share. \"The default is extremely valuable real estate... Even if a new entrant were positioned from a quality standpoint to bid for the default when an agreement expires, such a firm could compete only if it were prepared to pay partners upwards of billions of dollars in revenue share and make them whole for any revenue shortfalls resulting from the change,\" Mehta wrote. He noted \"Google, of course, recognizes that losing defaults would dramatically impact its bottom line. For instance, Google has projected that losing the Safari default would result in a significant drop in queries and billions of dollars in lost revenues.\" The ruling is the first major decision in a series of cases taking on alleged monopolies in Big Tech. \"A forced divestiture of the search business would sever Alphabet from its largest source of revenue. But even losing its capacity to strike exclusive default agreements could be detrimental for Google,\" said Emarketer senior analyst Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, who noted a drawn out legal process will delay any immediate effects for consumers. In the past four years, federal antitrust regulators have also sued Meta Platforms, Amazon.com, and Apple Inc, claiming the companies have illegally maintained monopolies. Another case against Google over its advertising technology is scheduled to go to trial in September. When it was filed in 2020, the Google search case was the first time in a generation that the U.S. government accused a major corporation of an illegal monopoly. Microsoft settled with the Justice Department in 2004 over claims that it forced its Internet Explorer web browser on Windows users.
