The U.S. government has revoked a waiver that allowed Taiwan Semiconductor to export essential chipmaking equipment and technology to its factory in Nanjing, China. This policy change, which took effect on December 31, removes the company’s fast-track export privilege, known as validated end-user (VEU) status, CNBC reported on Wednesday. Also Read: Taiwan Semiconductor Acts Early To Dodge US Export Curbs, Drops Chinese Tools From Chip Plants Taiwan Semiconductor received the VEU exemption in 2022 after the Commerce Department initially restricted the sale of chipmaking tools of U.S. origin to China. Under the new policy, Taiwan Semiconductor’s Nanjing facility must now obtain a U.S. export license for every shipment of American-made chipmaking equipment. The Bureau of Industry and Security also canceled the VEU privileges for South Korean chipmakers SK Hynix and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) on Friday. According to Brady Wang, an associate director at Counterpoint Research, the financial impact on Taiwan Semiconductor “should be minor” because its Nanjing fab accounts for less than 3% of the company’s total revenue. Despite geopolitical headwinds, investor sentiment toward Taiwan Semiconductor remains supported by strong demand tied to the global race in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company’s stock is up 16% year-to-date, reflecting optimism around surging capital expenditures from leading technology firms. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have pledged more than $250 billion in combined AI spending for 2025 and 2026. Alphabet’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) has lifted its 2025 forecast to $85 billion, while Microsoft’s annual capital outlays now exceed $100 billion. Meta alone plans to spend close to $100 billion in 2026, underscoring the scale of investment driving demand for advanced chips. Price Action: TSM stock is trading higher by 1.05% to $230.79 at last check Wednesday.

You are training a reasoning system. Your job is to read an article and break it down into core business events. We have a limited window of how many we can do, so focus on the top 1-4 events mentioned. You are only interested in this through the lens of how it will affect Apple.\n\nWe are analyzing the events through the perspective of Apple, and Apple alone, not other companies. So when we structure the business events, it's the events that will affect Apple. It could be industry moving, Apple moving, or it could be so miniscule. Consider this and ignore other companies except with their impact on Apple.\n\n**CRITICAL: This is STAGE 1 processing - extract business events ONLY. Do NOT create causal chains - that happens in stage 2.**\n\nKeep the representation abstract and reusable so it generalizes across companies and time. You are building repeatable, abstracted patterns. Don't get stuck in one-off details; instead, map events into reusable categories so that future articles can be compared.\n\n⸻\n\n## General Rules\n\n**CRITICAL: Articles often contain multiple distinct business events. Look for separate announcements, different product categories, or events with significantly different timelines (>12 months apart).

After Google was found to hold an illegal monopoly in its core market of internet search last year, the U.S. Department of Justice suggested Alphabet divest some of its assets, including selling off its Chrome browser. But the company avoided a worst-case scenario on Tuesday after a U.S. District judge ruled against some of the more severe proposed consequences, including a potential breakup. In the decision, the court said Alphabet won't be forced to sell Chrome, but will be barred from exclusive contracts that condition payments or licensing. In response, Wall Street sent both Alphabet and Apple higher, with investors viewing the decision as an even bigger win for the iPhone maker. Alphabet and Apple gained anywhere from 3.5% to 8.5% each in early trading. \"In what we'd describe as a near best-case scenario, AAPL can still collect [traffic acquisition costs] from GOOGL (with conditions) and can renegotiate the default search socket annually, better than our prior 'Scenario 4' framework & likely resulting in an immaterial, to potentially positive, financial impact,\" Morgan Stanley wrote in a Wednesday note. While Google will have to stop exclusivity payments for using its search function, the company can still pay for distribution on iPhones, including as the default search engine, Baird said. The bank estimated Google's annual payments to Apple at roughly $20 billion, or about 20% of Apple's Services revenue — 5% of its total revenue — and including \"disproportionately high margins.\" Analysts also highlighted Alphabet's loss of exclusivity as a major catalyst for Apple, since this will allow it to license other non-Google AI products even though Google's payments will continue to Apple. \"Non-exclusivity remedies allow AAPL to license non-GOOGL GenAI products (e.g. OpenAI),\" TD Cowen wrote. \"AAPL's Safari browser has the option for alternative [generative search experiences] for many years and AAPL currently licenses OpenAI's ChatGPT product.\" TD Cowen added that Google's revenue share payments could be a benchmark and \"valuable pricing reference\" to negotiate future revenue sharing from various generative AI partnerships, especially once Apple begins planning to offer a generative AI search option in its Safari browser. This will likely become more relevant as chatbots grow more popular as an alternative to the traditional search engine experience. Tuesday's positive decision helped reinforce Wall Street's bullish view on shares of Apple, with most analysts maintaining their buy-equivalent rating. Here's what analysts at some of the biggest investment banks had to say after the ruling. Bank of America: price target raised to $260 Bank of America lifted its price target to $260 per share from $250, implying upside of about 13%. \"While details and nuances of the ruling and their implication on Apple are still to be determined, and Google has the option of appealing this decision, in our opinion, we do not see an immediate material change to the current Apple-Google relationship and payment structure. Longer-term, data sharing with other search engines/Gen AI providers could pose headwinds to Apple from lower Google TAC payments … This ruling gives us more confidence in our Services revenue estimates which we model to grow 12% y/y in F26/F27. We est. 37% of Services revenue comes from Licensing of which Google TAC is a major contributor (22% of overall Services revenue).\" Morgan Stanley \"What we learned from Judge Mehta tonight should be viewed as the best-case outcome for Apple, and better than the 'most likely' Scenario 4 we highlighted in our prior analyses. Why? Because (1) GOOGL can continue to pay Apple to distribute search, (2) Apple can still set a default search engine (incl GOOGL) and receive payments for that, so long as Apple promotes other search engines and the default search engine is changed annually, and (3) Apple can — but is not required to — introduce a search choice screen to help recoup any change in payment terms related to the prior default search exclusivity Apple had with Google. Effectively, Apple needs to offer a bit more flexibility in distributing search to users, but the remedies are even more watered down than we expected.\" Baird \"For AAPL, we suspect it could continue to receive significant distribution payments from Google and of course over time could also evaluate opportunities with emerging platforms like OpenAI, Perplexity and others as they build broader ad platforms.\" TD Cowen \"We view the remedies as largely favorable for AAPL's advertising services business where third-party licensing agreements with GOOGL represent a low-20% of Service revenues and ~10% of total company gross profit. We believe GOOGL rev sharing could be in the low- $20B range despite Google search queries on the Safari browser declining for the first time due to the impact of GenAI chatbots on end user behavior.\" Goldman Sachs \"Given Apple can continue to receive traffic acquisition cost payments from Google, we view this decision as positive for AAPL, which we estimate to have received nearly ~$23 bn in TAC revenue in F2024. Further, the court ruling provides insight into Gemini Commercial Agreements, which provide for payments from Google to smartphone OEMs and wireless carriers for the distribution of Gemini experiences on its devices. This reinforces our view that Gen AI app & experience distribution presents a new and growing revenue stream for Apple and the US wireless carriers — similar to search TAC, but for Gen AI.\" Citi \"The antitrust ruling on Google removes a major overhang and downside risk on the Apple stock. Google is allowed to continue to pay TAC fees to Apple for it to be set as the default search engine so long as the deal is not exclusive, which means Apple 1) can promote other search engines, and 2) can set a different search engine on different operating system versions or in a privacy mode and makes changes, if needed, on an annual basis. We believe this could change pricing and help Apple negotiate the deal annually.\" UBS \"As part of the remedies proposed by the DOJ Google is prohibited from entering into or maintaining 'exclusive distribution agreements' covering Google Search, Chrome, Google Assistant and its GenAI products with partners including Apple on any device. However, Google will not be barred from making payments or offering other consideration to distribution partners for pre-loading or placement of Google products, effectively keeping the door open for Google to continue to pay Apple an estimated $20B to $25B annually.\" Evercore ISI \"Google pays Apple $15-20B/year in order to be the default search engine on Safari and we estimate around 50% of this is U.S. based. Though worth noting there is a 'fixed' and 'variable' component to this that we don't know the split of. The payment is a revenue sharing agreement where Google shares a portion of the money it makes on advertising as a result of Safari searches. The rise of AI search options has raised concerns that revenue from this agreement will start declining given Apple's testimony in the case indicated Safari search volume declined in April for the first time ever. On the AI front, AAPL today does get paid from Open AI for the default status on the LLM front.\"\n=================\n\nPlease provide structured analysis according to the schema."}],"response_format":{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"business_events_only","strict":true,"schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"article":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string","description":"Article identifier"},"headline":{"type":"string","description":"Headline of the article"},"source":{"type":"string","description":"Publisher (e.g., Bloomberg, Benzinga)"},"url":{"type":"string","description":"Canonical URL of the article"},"authors":{"type":"array","description":"Bylines or key reporters/analysts","items":{"type":"string"}},"published_at":{"type":"string","description":"Publication date/time (ISO 8601)","format":"date-time"},"publisher_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of publication source"},"author_credibility":{"description":"Track record of specific author(s)","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1},{"type":"null"}]},"source_credibility":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Reliability of information source quoted in article"},"audience_split":{"type":"string","enum":["institutional","retail","both","neither"],"description":"Primary investor audience"},"time_lag_days":{"description":"Time elapsed between event and publication","anyOf":[{"type":"number","minimum":0},{"type":"null"}]},"market_regime":{"description":"Current market regime context","anyOf":[{"type":"string","enum":["bull","bear","neutral","unknown"]},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["id","headline","source","url","authors","published_at","publisher_credibility","author_credibility","source_credibility","audience_split","time_lag_days","market_regime"],"additionalProperties":false},"business_events":{"type":"array","description":"List of detected business events (1-2 max)","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"event_type":{"type":"string","description":"Business action category"},"trigger":{"type":"string","description":"How the news surfaced","enum":["press_release","earnings_call","filing","analyst_report","media_report","rumor","social","other"]},"entities":{"type":"array","description":"Companies or organizations involved","items":{"type":"string"}},"scope":{"type":"string","description":"Impacted scope","enum":["company","industry"]},"orientation":{"type":"string","description":"Perspective","enum":["predictive","reflective","both","neutral"]},"time_horizon_days":{"type":"integer","minimum":0,"description":"Relevance window in days"},"tags":{"type":"array","description":"Reusable tags for categorization","items":{"type":"string"}},"quoted_people":{"type":"array","description":"Individuals quoted in the article","items":{"type":"string"}},"event_description":{"type":"string","description":"Brief summary of the event (max 15 words)"},"intensity":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Market attention level"},"certainty_truth":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Confidence in factual accuracy"},"certainty_impact":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1,"description":"Confidence this affects Apple value"},"hope_vs_fear":{"type":"number","minimum":-1,"maximum":1,"description":"Emotional valence (-1=fear, +1=hope)"},"surprise_vs_anticipated":{"type":"number","minimum":-1,"maximum":1,"description":"Expected vs shocking (-1=anticipated, +1=surprising)"},"consensus_vs_division":{"type":"number","minimum":-1,"maximum":1,"description":"Market agreement level (-1=division, +1=consensus)"},"positive_vs_negative_sentiment":{"type":"number","minimum":-1,"maximum":1,"description":"Overall tone (-1=negative, +1=positive)"}},"required":["event_type","trigger","entities","scope","orientation","time_horizon_days","tags","quoted_people","event_description","intensity","certainty_truth","certainty_impact","hope_vs_fear","surprise_vs_anticipated","consensus_vs_division","positive_vs_negative_sentiment"],"additionalProperties":false}}},"required":["article","business_events"],"additionalProperties":false}}}}}
