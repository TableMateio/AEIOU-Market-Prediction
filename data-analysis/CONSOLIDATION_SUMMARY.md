## Key Principles Applied

### Factor Names (Scalar Quantities)
**Original Count:** 2,419 → **Consolidated Count:** ~40 core categories

**Rules Applied:**
1. **Remove Company Prefixes:** "apple_revenue_growth_rate" → "revenue_growth_rate"
2. **Focus on Scalar Qualities:** Must represent measurable quantities that can increase/decrease
3. **Consolidate Similar Concepts:** All analyst-related terms → "analyst_rating_change"
4. **Universal Applicability:** Terms work for any company, not just Apple

**Major Consolidations:**
- **analyst_rating_change:** 25+ analyst-related terms
- **revenue_growth_rate:** 60+ revenue growth variations
- **market_share:** 45+ market share variations
- **investment_level:** 80+ investment-related terms
- **stock_price:** 25+ stock price variations
- **operating_margin:** 30+ margin-related terms
- **demand_level:** 50+ demand-related terms
- **cost_level:** 100+ cost-related terms
- **supply_chain_risk:** 85+ supply chain terms
- **competitive_pressure:** 75+ competitive terms

### Event Types (Discrete Occurrences)
**Original Count:** 467 → **Consolidated Count:** ~35 core categories

**Rules Applied:**
1. **Group Similar Events:** All analyst updates consolidated
2. **Remove Company References:** Universal applicability
3. **Focus on Actionable Events:** Things that trigger market reactions

**Major Consolidations:**
- **analyst_update:** All analyst-related events
- **earnings_report:** Financial reporting events
- **product_launch:** Product and innovation events
- **regulatory_action:** Legal and regulatory events
- **market_update:** Market and macroeconomic events
- **partnership_deal:** M&A and partnership events
- **leadership_change:** Executive and governance events

### Event Tags (Categorical Themes)
**Original Count:** 70 → **Consolidated Count:** ~35 categories

**Rules Applied:**
1. **Remove Company-Specific Tags:** "apple_pay" → "payment_processing"
2. **Consolidate Technology Categories:** AI variants → "ai"
3. **Generalize Product Categories:** "iphone" → "hardware"

## Business Impact

### Before Consolidation
- **2,419 factor names** - Too granular, company-specific, inconsistent
- **467 event types** - Overlapping, redundant variations
- **70 event tags** - Mix of products, companies, and themes
- **2,249 factor synonyms** - Massive duplication

### After Consolidation
- **~40 factor categories** - Universal, scalar, measurable
- **~35 event types** - Clear, actionable, universal
- **~35 tags** - Consistent categorical themes
- **Systematic transformation mappings** - Traceable consolidation

## Key Benefits

### 1. **Scalability**
- System now works for any company, not just Apple
- New companies can use same factor/event structure
- Reduces data complexity by 95%+

### 2. **Analytical Power**
- Factors represent true scalar quantities for modeling
- Events are discrete, actionable occurrences
- Consistent categorization enables pattern recognition

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Clear transformation rules for future data
- Systematic approach to handling new variations
- Preserved original data for reference

### 4. **Business Clarity**
- Factors align with business metrics investors care about
- Events represent market-moving occurrences
- Tags provide consistent thematic categorization

## Implementation Notes

### For Factor Names
- All consolidated factors can have numerical values
- Represent measurable business impacts
- Can increase/decrease over time
- Universal across industries/companies

### For Event Types
- Represent discrete occurrences
- Trigger market reactions
- Can be timestamped
- Have clear business meaning

### For Event Tags
- Provide categorical context
- Enable thematic analysis
- Support filtering and grouping
- Maintain analytical consistency

## Next Steps
1. **Validation:** Review consolidated terms with business stakeholders
2. **Implementation:** Create automated transformation logic
3. **Testing:** Validate on subset of data
4. **Documentation:** Create detailed mapping specifications
5. **Deployment:** Apply to full dataset

## Files Created
- **3 transformation mappings** showing original → consolidated
- **3 enum lists** with final consolidated terms
- **Preserved original data** for reference and validation
- **This summary** documenting the entire process

This consolidation transforms a complex, company-specific dataset into a universal business event and factor taxonomy suitable for cross-company analysis and machine learning applications.
