# Factor Names Improvements Summary

## Key Issues Identified & Resolved

### 1. **Missing Customer Dynamics** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Original consolidation missed critical customer-specific metrics
**Solution:** Added dedicated "Customer Dynamics" category with:
- `customer_demand` - Direct demand measurement
- `customer_buying_power` - Purchasing power and spending behavior  
- `customer_retention_rate` - Customer loyalty metrics
- `customer_sentiment` - Customer perception and satisfaction
- `product_refresh_cycle` - Replacement and upgrade cycles

### 2. **Missing Supply Dynamics** ✅ FIXED  
**Problem:** Supply factors were buried in operational metrics
**Solution:** Extracted `supply_availability` as distinct factor covering:
- Chip supply constraints/increases
- Component availability  
- Supplier capacity and reliability
- Supply chain diversification

### 3. **Over-Detailed Industry Categories** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Too many specific technology categories (AI, chips, data center, cloud, autonomous)
**Solution:** Consolidated into universal categories:
- `technology_advancement_rate` - General tech progress
- `digital_transformation_level` - Technology adoption maturity

### 4. **Missing Product Strategy Factors** ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Product differentiation wasn't clearly captured
**Solution:** Added `product_differentiation` covering:
- Competitive advantages
- Product performance superiority
- Strategic moats and positioning

## Updated Factor Structure

### Customer-Focused Factors (NEW)
- **customer_demand** - Market demand from customers
- **customer_buying_power** - Customer purchasing capacity  
- **customer_retention_rate** - Customer loyalty/churn
- **product_refresh_cycle** - Replacement cycle timing

### Supply-Focused Factors (ENHANCED)
- **supply_availability** - Component/input availability
- **supply_chain_risk** - Supply disruption risks

### Strategic Factors (ENHANCED)
- **product_differentiation** - Competitive product advantages
- **competitive_pressure** - Market competition intensity

### Simplified Technology (CONSOLIDATED)
- **technology_advancement_rate** - Overall tech progress
- **digital_transformation_level** - Tech adoption maturity

## Business Impact

### Before Updates
- Missing direct customer demand measurement
- Supply factors unclear/buried  
- Over-specific technology categories
- Product differentiation not explicit

### After Updates  
- **Complete customer dimension** - demand, buying power, retention, cycles
- **Clear supply dynamics** - availability separate from risk
- **Universal technology factors** - applicable across industries
- **Explicit product strategy** - differentiation as measurable factor

## Key Mappings Added

### Customer Demand (21 original terms → 1 consolidated)
